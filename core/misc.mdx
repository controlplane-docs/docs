## Grafana Alerts

Alerts can be created from the Org's Grafana instance. Refer to these [instructions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/unified-alerting/alerting-rules/create-grafana-managed-rule/) on how to create a Grafana managed alert.

### Built-in Alert Rules

The Grafana instance accessed via the "Metrics" link of your Workload comes with several automatically provisioned objects, including built-in alert rules. These rules can send notifications to one or several of your preferred contact points (e.g., email). By default, notifications for these alerts are disabled. To receive notifications, you must add a contact point (refer to the Grafana [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/fundamentals/notifications/contact-points/)).

You can find the built-in alert rules in your Grafana instance under `Alerts` > `Alert rules`:

- `container-restarts`

  - This alert triggers if any of your workloads restart repeatedly. Specifically, it activates if the Control Plane custom metric `container_restarts` is greater than 1 in the last 5 minutes.

- `stuck-deployments`

  - This alert triggers if any of your deployments are stuck.
  - It checks for multiple container restarts within specific groups (gvc and workload). If any group exceeds one restart in the last 15 minutes, it triggers an alert.

To edit or create new alerts, go to the `Alerts` > `Alert rules` section in your Grafana instance.

If you edit built-in alerts, your changes will be saved. However, if you delete any built-in alerts, they will be recreated automatically the next time you log in to Grafana.

To disable built-in alerts, edit the corresponding alert rule and turn on the `Pause evaluation` toggle in the alert editing view.

## Tags

Most Control Plane resources can be labeled with multiple key-value pairs called tags.

These tags can be used by the UI or other resource to query / filter / select a resource based on its keys and value.

A majority of resources will have a `Query` button that will show the following modal allowing you to filter the resources shown.

[Group](/reference/group) and [policy](/reference/policy) can use a query to dynamically assign members and resources, respectively.

The `Match Tags By` selector values are:

| Selector | Definition                      |
| :------- | :------------------------------ |
| All      | All tag items should match      |
| Any      | Any of the tags should match    |
| None     | None of these tags should match |

To filter resources based on their tags:

1. Click on the `Query` button
2. Select the wanted match tag selector
3. Enter a tag name, equality operator, and value. Click `Add`.
4. Enter any additional tags
5. Click `Apply` and the filtered resources will be displayed

To remove the filter, click on the `Query` button again and click `Clear`.
