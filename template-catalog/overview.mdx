## Overview

Quickly deploy and manage applications such as databases, queues, and even stateless apps directly on Control Plane.

Templates are configured to create any required Control Plane resources with user specified values to create a production ready application in seconds.

Each template release has a version which can be specified when installing or upgrading.

All installs and revisions are tracked under the template's release.
