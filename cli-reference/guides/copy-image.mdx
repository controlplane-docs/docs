title: Copy Images Between Organizations
description: Copy container images from one Control Plane organization to another using the CLI.
---

Copy container images between Control Plane organizations. The CLI handles authentication to both registries automatically, pulling, retagging, and pushing the image in one command.

## When to use this

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cross-org sharing" icon="share-nodes">
    Share images between teams in different organizations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment promotion" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Promote images from dev to staging to production orgs
  </Card>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="CLI installed">
  Install the Control Plane CLI. See [Installation](/cli-reference/installation).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Docker installed">
  Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com). The CLI uses Docker to pull, tag, and push images.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Access to both organizations">
  You need:
  - Pull permission on images in the source org
  - Push permission on images in the destination org

  See [Image Permissions](/reference/image#minimum-policy).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Profiles configured (for cross-org)">
  If copying between orgs that use different credentials, create a profile for each org:

  ```bash
  # Profile for source org and mark it as default
  cpln profile create source-profile --login --org source-org --default

  # Profile for destination org
  cpln profile create dest-profile --login --org dest-org
  ```

  See [Profiles](/cli-reference/get-started/profiles) for details.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Basic usage

Copy an image to another organization:

```bash
cpln image copy my-app:v1 --to-org destination-org
```

This command:
1. Authenticates Docker to both organization registries
2. Pulls the image from your current org
3. Tags it for the destination org
4. Pushes it to the destination org

## Copy with a different name

Use `--to-name` to rename the image during copy:

```bash
cpln image copy my-app:v1 --to-org destination-org --to-name renamed-app:v1
```

This copies `my-app:v1` to `destination-org` as `renamed-app:v1`.

## Copy between orgs with different credentials

When organizations use different authentication contexts, specify a profile for the destination org:

```bash
cpln image copy my-app:v1 \
  --to-org destination-org \
  --to-profile dest-profile
```

<Tip>
Your default profile (or `CPLN_PROFILE`) is used for the source org. The `--to-profile` flag specifies credentials for the destination.
</Tip>

## Clean up local images

By default, the CLI leaves the pulled and retagged images on your local machine. Use `--cleanup` to remove them after a successful copy:

```bash
cpln image copy my-app:v1 --to-org destination-org --cleanup
```

This is useful in CI/CD pipelines to avoid filling up disk space.

## Command reference

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<ref>` | Source image reference (e.g., `my-app:v1`) |
| `--to-org` | Target organization to copy the image to |
| `--to-name` | New name and tag for the image (optional) |
| `--to-profile` | Profile for authenticating to the destination org (optional) |
| `--cleanup` | Remove local images after successful copy (default: false) |

## Common workflows

### Environment promotion

Promote an image from development to production:

```bash
# Using default profile for dev org
cpln image copy my-app:v1.2.3 \
  --to-org my-org-production \
  --to-profile production-profile
```

### CI/CD pipeline

Copy and clean up in automated pipelines:

```bash
# Copy with cleanup to save disk space
cpln image copy my-app:$CI_COMMIT_SHA \
  --to-org production-org \
  --to-profile prod-profile \
  --cleanup
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Authentication failed for source org">
  Verify you're logged in to the source org:

  ```bash
  cpln profile get
  ```

  Re-authenticate if needed:
  ```bash
  cpln login
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication failed for destination org">
  Check the destination profile has valid credentials:

  ```bash
  cpln profile get dest-profile
  ```

  Re-authenticate the profile:
  ```bash
  cpln login dest-profile
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Push denied">
  Verify you have push permission on images in the destination org. Check your policies or ask an org admin to grant access. Also check the org name for any typos.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Image not found">
  Verify the source image exists:

  ```bash
  cpln image get my-app:v1
  ```

  Check the exact image name and tag.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Docker daemon not running">
  Start Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon.
