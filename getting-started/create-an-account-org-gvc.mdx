title: "1. Create an Account & Org"
---

Currently, only way to create a Control Plane account is through the [Console](https://console.cpln.io/signup). 

<Note>
You will need to input a credit card to be able to create an account and use the platform. 

No money will be collected outside of the usage.
</Note>

During the account creation, you are also asked to create an [Org](/objects/org) and a [GVC](/objects/gvc).

If somehow you have issues while creating the org and gvc, you can still create them afterwards. See the guides [Create an Org](/guides/create-an-org) and [Create a GVC](/guides/create-a-gvc).
