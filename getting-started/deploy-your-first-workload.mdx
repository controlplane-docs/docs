title: 2. Deploy Your First Workload
---

## Overview

Follow the steps below to get started using Control Plane by deploying a sample application.

This quick start will demonstrate:

- Logging in to the Control Plane console.
- Creating a [GVC](/reference/gvc) and a [Workload](/reference/workload).
- Deploying an application to multiple cloud providers and locations.

## Prerequisites

- Your email address is an active [user](/reference/user) of an [Org](/reference/org) and
  a member of the `superusers` [group](/reference/group).

## Step One - Log in

1. Browse to: [https://console.cpln.io](https://console.cpln.io)
2. The login page will be displayed:
   - Select the single sign-on (SSO) provider that is connected to your email address.
   - If prompted, enter your email address and password.
   - You will now be logged into the console.

## Step Two - Create a GVC

In this step, you will create a [GVC](/reference/gvc) and map it to two cloud providers
in two locations.

If you are not already on the `Create GVC` form, click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `GVC`.

1. Enter a [GVC](/reference/gvc) name (e.g., foo-bar-gvc) and click `Next (Locations)`.

2. Select the desired locations. For this quickstart, we'll select:

   - `aws-eu-central-1`
   - `gcp-us-east1`

3. Click `Create`. The [GVC](/reference/gvc) will be created and the `Info` page will be shown.

## Step Three - Create a Workload

In this step, you will deploy a sample application by creating a [Workload](/reference/workload).

1. Click `Workloads` from the left side menu. Once the form is loaded, click the `New` button.
2. Enter a [Workload](/reference/workload) name (e.g., foo-bar-workload) and click `Next (Container 1)`.
3. In the `Image` textbox, enter:

```bash
cplnquickstarts/helloworld-go
```

<Note>

The image `cplnquickstarts/helloworld-go` is a web app written in Go.

When the Workload is navigated to, it will display the cloud provider and location in the browser.

</Note>

4. Toggle on the `Serves Traffic` switch to indicate that this [Workload](/reference/workload) will be serving requests on port 8080.
   - **Note**: The default port number in the UI is 8080 and happens to be the exposed port of the sample web app. Your containerized application may expose any other port except for the ports listed [here](/reference/workload#ports).
5. At the top of the Workload form, click the `Make Public` button. This will allow all inbound and outbound requests to/from the Workload.
6. Click the `Create` button. The [Workload](/reference/workload) will be created and the `Info` page will be shown.

## Step Four - Browse to the running Workload

In this step, you will browse to the global endpoint URL that was generated for this [Workload](/reference/workload). This URL is automatically secured using TLS, load balanced, and DNS geo-routed to the nearest healthy location.

1. After a minute or two, if the deployment was successful, the `Workload Health` will indicate `Ready`.
2. Click the `Open` link besides the `Global Endpoint` URL to launch the application in a new tab.
3. The output of the sample application will be shown indicating the cloud provider and location closest to you that served the request.

## Step Five - View individual deployments

In this step, you will launch the sample application at each [Location](/reference/location).

1. Return to the console and click `Deployments`.
2. Next to each location is an `Open` link that will launch the application at its respective location. Take note that the URL is secured using TLS.

The output for each location will be similar to:

<CodeGroup>

```text aws-eu-central-1
Hello World!

Provider: aws
Location: /org/ORG_NAME/location/aws-eu-central-1
```

```text gcp-us-east1
Hello World!

Provider: gcp
Location: /org/ORG_NAME/location/gcp-us-east1
```

</CodeGroup>

## Summary

With a minimal amount of effort, you were able to deploy an application to multiple cloud providers and locations. This [Workload](/reference/workload) is now managed by Control Plane and you can easily modify any of the available options.
