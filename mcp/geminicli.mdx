description: Configure the Control Plane MCP Server for Gemini CLI
---

Connect Gemini CLI to Control Plane to manage your infrastructure through natural language conversations.

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Gemini CLI" icon="download">
    Get started with [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/docs/get-started/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Account Token" icon="key">
    Create a [service account](/guides/create-service-account) with appropriate permissions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


## Configuration

### Step 1: Add the MCP Server

Use the `gemini mcp add` command to register the Control Plane MCP Server:

```bash
gemini mcp add --transport http cpln https://mcp.cpln.io/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <your-service-account-token>" \
  --scope user
```

<Warning>
  Replace `<your-service-account-token>` with your actual service account token.
</Warning>

We recommend the **user** scope to make the MCP server available across all your projects. Without `--scope user`, the default is local scope which only applies to the current directory.

<Tip>
  You can also use `--scope project` to add the server for the current project only. See the [Gemini CLI Documentation](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/) for more details on scopes.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Verify the Connection

List your configured MCP servers to confirm the setup:

```bash
gemini mcp list
```

You should see `cpln` listed with a successful connection:

```
cpln: https://mcp.cpln.io/mcp (HTTP) - ✓ Connected
```

### Managing MCP Servers

```bash
# List all MCP servers
gemini mcp list

# Remove an MCP server
gemini mcp remove cpln

# Get help on MCP commands
gemini mcp --help
```

<Note>
  For the latest configuration options and troubleshooting, refer to the official [Gemini CLI Documentation](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/).

## Example Conversation

Here's an example of deploying a public workload through Claude:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Context">
    ```
    Use org "my-org" and gvc "my-gvc" for context.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy a Workload">
    ```
    Create a publicly accessible workload called "my-api" using nginx:latest on port 80.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get the Endpoint">
    ```
    Monitor the readiness of my-api and give me the public endpoint once it's ready.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    - Check that your service account token is valid.
    - Ensure the token is entered without extra spaces or quotes.
    - Verify the token has appropriate permissions (see [Service Account Permissions](/mcp/overview#service-account-permissions)).
    - **Check for typos in the org name** you're using for context, this is a common cause of authentication failures.
