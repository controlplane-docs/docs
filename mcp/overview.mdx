description: Connect AI assistants and coding tools to Control Plane using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
---

The Control Plane MCP Server enables AI assistants and coding tools to interact directly with your Control Plane infrastructure. Using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), you can create, manage, and deploy resources through natural language conversations.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that allows AI models to securely connect to external tools and data sources. With the Control Plane MCP Server, AI assistants can:

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Service Account">
    Create a [service account](/guides/create-service-account) with the appropriate permissions for your use case. Generate an API key that
    will be used for authentication.
    <Tip>
      For quick setup, add your service account to the **superusers** group for full access, or the **viewers** group for read-only access.
      See [Service Account Permissions](#service-account-permissions) below for details.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Your Client">
    Add the Control Plane MCP Server to your AI assistant or coding tool. See the [setup guides](#compatible-tools) below for tool-specific instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Building">Begin interacting with Control Plane through natural language commands.</Step>
</Steps>

## MCP Server Endpoint

<ParamField path="url" type="string" required>
  ``` https://mcp.cpln.io/mcp ```
</ParamField>

## Authentication

The MCP Server requires authentication via a service account token. Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: <your-service-account-token>
```

<Warning>Keep your service account token secure. Never commit tokens to version control or share them publicly.</Warning>

## Compatible Tools

The Control Plane MCP Server works with **any AI assistant or development tool that supports remote MCP servers**. Below are setup guides for popular tools:

<Note>
  Don't see your tool listed? Any client that supports remote MCP servers can connect to the Control Plane MCP Server using the standard configuration format. Check your tool's documentation for remote MCP server setup instructions.
</Note>

## Service Account Permissions

The MCP Server respects all Control Plane [policies](/reference/policy) and permissions. Your service account's capabilities depend on the groups and policies assigned to it.

### Built-in Groups

Control Plane provides two built-in groups for common permission patterns:

| Group          | Permissions               | Use Case                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **viewers**    | `view` on all resources   | Read-only exploration, querying infrastructure status |
| **superusers** | `manage` on all resources | Full automation, creating and modifying all resources |

### Custom Permissions

For more granular control, you can:

1. Create custom [groups](/reference/group) with specific members
2. Define [policies](/reference/policy) that grant targeted permissions
3. Assign your service account to groups that match your use case

<Tip>
  Create dedicated service accounts for different environments (development, staging, production) with appropriate permission scopes. For
  detailed information on permissions and policies, see the [Policy Reference](/reference/policy).
</Tip>

### Recommended Approaches

| Use Case                | Recommended Setup                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick exploration       | Add service account to **viewers** group                          |
| Full development access | Add service account to **superusers** group                       |
| Production automation   | Create custom group with specific policies for required resources |
| Team-specific access    | Create group per team with policies scoped to their GVCs          |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with Context" icon="bullseye">
    Always set your org and GVC context at the start of a conversation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="list-check">
    Provide specific values for resources (memory, CPU, replicas) when possible
  </Card>
  <Card title="Confirm Destructive Actions" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Configure your AI assistant to confirm before executing delete or update operations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Tags" icon="tags">
    Add tags to resources for better organization and filtering
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended Prompts Structure

For the best results, structure your prompts with:

1. **Context**: Org and GVC
2. **Action**: What you want to do
3. **Target**: Which resource
4. **Details**: Specific configuration values

<CodeGroup>
```text Good Prompt
Using org "my-org" and GVC "production", create a workload called "api-v2" 
with image nginx:latest, 512Mi memory, port 8080, and minimum 2 replicas.
```

```text Less Effective
Make a new workload.
```
