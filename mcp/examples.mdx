description: Practical examples of using the Control Plane MCP Server with AI assistants
---

This page provides practical examples of how to interact with Control Plane through AI assistants using the MCP Server. These examples work across all [compatible tools](/mcp/overview#compatible-tools).

## Setting Context

Before performing operations, always set your organization and GVC context:

<CodeGroup>
```text Natural Language
Use org "my-org" and gvc "my-gvc" for the following operations.
```

```text Alternative
Set my Control Plane context to organization "my-org" and GVC "my-gvc".
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Setting context once at the start of a conversation helps the AI assistant understand which resources to target.</Tip>

---

## GVC Operations

### Create a GVC

Create a new [Global Virtual Cloud](/concepts/gvc) with specific locations. You can use friendly location names or technical location IDs:

<CodeGroup>
```text Basic GVC (Friendly Names)
Create a new GVC called "production" with locations in Frankfurt, Virginia, and Dublin.
```

```text Basic GVC (Technical IDs)
Create a new GVC called "production" with locations in aws-us-east-1 and aws-eu-west-1.
```

```text Multi-Cloud GVC
Create a GVC named "multi-cloud-app" with locations:
- azure-centralus
- gcp-me-west1
- aws-eu-central-1
```

```text With Description
Create a GVC called "staging" with these settings:
- Description: "Staging environment for QA testing"
- Locations: Frankfurt, Dublin
- Tags: environment=staging, team=platform
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  You can use friendly location names (like "Frankfurt", "Virginia", "Dublin") or technical location IDs (like "aws-eu-central-1", "aws-us-east-1"). The MCP server will resolve friendly names to the appropriate location IDs.
</Tip>

### List GVCs

```text
Show me all GVCs in the org "my-org".
```

### Get GVC Details

```text
Get the details of GVC "production" including its locations and configuration.
```

## Workload Operations

### Create a Workload

Create a new [workload](/concepts/workload) with various configurations:

<CodeGroup>
```text Basic Workload
Create a publicly accessible workload called "api-server" with:
- Image: nginx:latest
- Port: 80
- Memory: 256Mi
- CPU: 250m
```

```text Web Application
Deploy a publicly accessible workload named "web-frontend" with these specifications:
- Container image: httpd:latest
- Exposed port: 80
- Memory: 512Mi
- CPU: 500m
- Min replicas: 2
- Max replicas: 5
- Health check path: /
```

```text Background Worker
Create a cron workload called "data-processor" that:
- Uses image: python:3.11-slim
- Runs every hour (0 * * * *)
- Has 1Gi memory
- CPU: 500m
- Does not need external access
```

</CodeGroup>

### Update a Workload

<CodeGroup>
```text Scale Up
Scale the workload "api-server" to a minimum of 3 replicas and maximum of 5 replicas.
```

```text Update Image
Update the "web-frontend" workload to use image httpd:2.4-alpine.
```

```text Add Environment Variables
Add these environment variables to workload "api-server":
- DATABASE_URL: postgres://db.example.com:5432/mydb
- CACHE_ENABLED: true
- LOG_LEVEL: info
```

</CodeGroup>

### List Workloads

```text
List all workloads in GVC "production" with their current replica counts and status.
```

### Get Workload Status

```text
Show me the detailed status of workload "api-server" including:
- Current replicas
- Deployment status per location
- Recent events or errors
```

### Delete a Workload

```text
Delete the workload "old-service" from GVC "staging".
```

<Warning>Deletion operations are irreversible. The AI assistant should be configured to confirm before executing destructive operations.</Warning>

---

## Image Operations

### Build an Image

<Note>
  The `cpln` CLI must be [installed](/reference/cli#installation) and [configured with a profile](/guides/manage-profile) that is authenticated to the target organization. If no Dockerfile is present, the `cpln image build` command will use buildpacks to automatically create an image. Control Plane images are built for the `linux/amd64` platform.
</Note>

Build and push a container image to the Control Plane private registry:

```text
Build and push an image called "my-app:v1.0.0" from the current directory 
to the Control Plane registry in org "my-org".
```

### List Images

```text
Show me all images in org "my-org" with their tags and creation dates.
```

### Get Image Details

```text
Get the details of image "my-app" including all available tags and their digests.
```

---

## Complex Workflows

### Full Application Deployment

```text
Deploy a complete application stack to Control Plane:

1. Create a GVC called "my-app-prod" in Frankfurt and Virginia

2. Create a publicly accessible workload "frontend" with:
   - Image: httpd:latest
   - Port: 80
   - Memory: 512Mi
   - CPU: 500m
   - 2-5 replicas

3. Create a publicly accessible workload "backend" with:
   - Image: nginx:latest
   - Port: 8080
   - Memory: 1Gi
   - CPU: 500m
   - 2-5 replicas
   - Environment variable SERVICE_NAME=backend
```

### Environment Promotion

```text
Promote the configuration from GVC "staging" to "production":
1. Get the current workload configurations from staging
2. Update the production workloads to match staging
3. Show me the differences before and after
```

### Debugging Session

```text
Help me debug the workload "api-server" in production:
1. Show me the current status and replica count
2. Check if there are any error events
3. Get the recent logs if possible
4. Show me the resource utilization
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with Context" icon="bullseye">
    Always set your org and GVC context at the start of a conversation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="list-check">
    Provide specific values for resources (memory, CPU, replicas) when possible
  </Card>
  <Card title="Confirm Destructive Actions" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Configure your AI assistant to confirm before executing delete or update operations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Tags" icon="tags">
    Add tags to resources for better organization and filtering
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended Prompts Structure

For the best results, structure your prompts with:

1. **Context**: Org and GVC
2. **Action**: What you want to do
3. **Target**: Which resource
4. **Details**: Specific configuration values

<CodeGroup>
```text Good Prompt
Using org "my-org" and GVC "production", create a workload called "api-v2" 
with image nginx:latest, 512Mi memory, port 8080, and minimum 2 replicas.
```

```text Less Effective
Make a new workload.
```
