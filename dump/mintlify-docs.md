    Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second Card" icon="square-2">

  </Card>

    Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fourth Card" icon="square-4">
    Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```


###¬†Props

- cols (number, default: 2)
  - The number of columns per row

## Code Blocks
Display code with optional syntax highlighting

‚Äã
### Basic Code Block
Use fenced code blocks by enclosing code in three backticks.

```md
"```javascript (without " characters in real case)
const hello = "world";
```"
```

### Syntax Highlighting
Put the name of your programming language after the three backticks to get syntax highlighting.

We use Prism for syntax highlighting. Test Drive Prism lists all the languages supported.

```
"```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```"
```

### Names
You can add more text after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.

```jsx
"```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```"
```

### Line Highlighting
You can highlight specific lines in your code blocks by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces {} and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

```jsx
"```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```"
```

##¬†Code Groups
The CodeGroup component lets you combine code blocks in a display separated by tabs

You will need to make Code Blocks then add the <CodeGroup> component around them. Every Code Block must have a filename because we use the names for the tab buttons.

```jsx
<CodeGroup>

"```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```"

"```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```"

"```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```"

</CodeGroup>
```

## Steps
Sequence content using the Steps component

Steps are the best way to display a series of actions of events to your users. You can add as many steps as desired.

```jsx
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the first step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the second step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
    These are instructions or content that only pertain to the third step.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```
