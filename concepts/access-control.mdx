title: Access Control
---

Access control on the Control Plane Platform is handled in two separate ways: one for billing accounts, and the other for orgs.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Billing Account">

Billing accounts have three roles that can be assigned when inviting users:

| Role | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `billing_admin` | Full administrative access to billing settings and invoices |
| `billing_viewer` | Read-only access to billing information |
| `org_creator` | Ability to create new organizations under the billing account |

</Tab>

<Tab title="Organization">

For access control on [orgs](/reference/org), there is a policy system that relies on **principals** and **bindings**. This enables fine-grained authorization rules to define the minimum amount of permissions required when accessing resources of the platform.

<Note>
Organization access control follows the principle of least privilege - grant only the permissions necessary for a principal to perform their tasks.
</Note>

## Principals

A "principal" is an entity that can be granted permissions. The Control Plane Platform supports four principal types, each scoped to an [org](/reference/org).

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User" icon="user" href="/reference/user">
    A distinct human being associated with an email. Users are members of one or more orgs and can be invited by authorized principals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Service Account" icon="robot" href="/reference/serviceaccount">
    A non-human principal for automation and CI/CD pipelines. Service accounts can be associated with a group on creation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Group" icon="users" href="/reference/group">
    A named collection of users and service accounts. Permissions granted to a group via policies are automatically applied to all its members.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Identity" icon="fingerprint" href="/reference/identity">
    A workload identity that grants cloud access and network resource permissions. Reusable across multiple workloads.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Policy

A [policy](/reference/policy) governs resource access within an [org](/reference/org) by binding principals to permissions on target resources.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Target Resources" icon="bullseye">
    A resource is a Control Plane object (e.g., [secret](/reference/secret), [workload](/reference/workload/general), [GVC](/reference/gvc), etc.).

    A policy can target:
    - **All resources** of a specific type within your org
    - **Specific resources** assigned directly by resource self link
    - **Dynamic resources** matched using [tag queries](/core/misc#tags)

    For example, a policy can target all GVCs in your org, or specifically only "production-gvc" and "staging-gvc".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bindings" icon="link">
    A binding maps permissions to principals:

    - **Permissions**: Actions like `create`, `delete`, `edit`, `view`, etc. The [available permissions](/reference/policy#permissions) vary by resource type.
    - **Principals**: [Users](/reference/user), [groups](/reference/group), [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount), or [identities](/reference/identity) that receive the permissions.

    Multiple bindings can exist on a single policy, allowing different permission sets for different principals.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Team access via groups">
    Create a [group](/reference/group) for your team and add users as members. Create a [policy](/reference/policy) that grants the group permissions on target resources (e.g., `view` and `edit` on specific GVCs). All group members automatically receive these permissions. When team members change, simply update group membership - no policy changes needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CI/CD automation with service accounts">
    Create a [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) and generate a key for authentication. Add the service account to a group with appropriate permissions, or create a policy granting it `create` and `edit` permissions on workloads. Create a CLI profile using `cpln profile create PROFILE_NAME --org ORG_NAME --token KEY --default`. The `--default` flag makes this profile active for all future commands without needing to specify `--profile` each time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Workload access to secrets">
    Create an [identity](/reference/identity) and link it to your [workload](/reference/workload/general). Create a [policy](/reference/policy) that grants the identity `reveal` permission on the target [secret](/reference/secret). Reference the secret in your workload as an environment variable (`cpln://secret/SECRET_NAME`) or volume mount. The workload can now access the secret value at runtime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Infrastructure as Code automation">
    Create a [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) for Terraform or Pulumi. Generate a key and configure your provider to authenticate with it. Create policies granting the service account permissions to manage the resources your IaC templates define (GVCs, workloads, secrets, identities, etc.).
  </Accordion>
