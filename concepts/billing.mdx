## Overview

A billing account allows you to manage user access, invoices, payment methods, and spending threshold alerts. You can create multiple billing accounts to manage billing separately.

In each billing account, you can access:

- [Account Details](#account-details): Manage personal details, billing information, and spend threshold email alert.  
- [Orgs](/reference/org): View the orgs linked to this billing account.  
- Invoices: View and download invoices.  
- Payment Methods: Add, update, or remove payment methods.  
- [Users](#users): Manage user access, roles, and permissions. 
- Cost & Usage: Review cost and usage across all orgs in this billing account. 

### Account Details

View and manage your billing account information.

### Spend Threshold Email Alert 
Spend threshold email alerts help you monitor your billing account. You must first enable the spend alert to receive an email when you reach the monthly limit that has been set.

### Users

You can add users to your billing account. You must assign them a role of either billing_admin or billing_viewer. Additionally, you can assign a user as an org_creator. The user will gain immediate access to the billing account once added.
