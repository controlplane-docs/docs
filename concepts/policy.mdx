## Overview

A policy governs resource access within an [org](/reference/org) to a set of principals. It enables fine-grained authorization rules to define the minimum amount of permissions required when accessing resources of the platform.

A policy consists of:

- A resource, and
- One or more bindings

### Resource

A resource is a Control Plane object (e.g., [secret](/reference/secret), [workload](/concepts/workload), [GVC](/reference/gvc), etc.).

A policy can be configured to target all or specific resources within your [org](/reference/org).

For example, a policy can target all the [GVCs](/reference/gvc) within your [org](/reference/org), or specifically GVC A and GVC B.

Specific resources can be assigned directly or dynamically (using a [query](/core/misc#tags)).

### Bindings

A binding is a mapping between:

- A set of permissions (e.g., create, delete, etc.), and
- Principal membership

The [set of permissions](/reference/policy#permissions) that can be assigned to a policy are unique to each resource.

Principals can be [users](/reference/user), [groups](/reference/group), [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount), and [identities](/reference/identity).

## Examples

- Allow a [user](/reference/user) or [group](/reference/group) access to the console
- Allow a [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) to execute CLI commands
- Allow an [identity](/reference/identity) access to reveal a secret. The [identity](/reference/identity) can then be associated with a [workload](/concepts/workload). The workload's containers will have permissions to access the [secret](/reference/secret) and use it as an environment variable.
