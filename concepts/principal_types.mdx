title: Principal Types
---

## Overview

A “principal” is somewhat of an overloaded term representing an “identity”.

The Control Plane Platform supports 4 principal types.

Each principal type is scoped to an [org](/reference/org) and can be granted permissions to certain resources or whole resource types through [policies](/reference/policy).

1. [Users](/reference/user)

   A [user](/reference/user) represents a distinct human being. This principal type is associated with an email. A user is a member of one or more [orgs](/reference/org). An authorized principal can invite users to an [org](/reference/org) (by providing their email address).

2. [Service Accounts](/reference/serviceaccount)

   A [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) is a non-human, often an application that is utilized to consume the [API](/api-reference/api).

3. [Groups](/reference/group)

   A [group](/reference/group) is a named collection of [users](/reference/user) and [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount). When inviting users to an [org](/reference/org), a [group](/reference/group) can optionally be assigned to the inviting users.

4. [Identity](/reference/identity)

   An [identity](/reference/identity) is short for workload identity. It is a reusable (can be leveraged by multiple workloads) named principal that is only used by [workloads](workload). An identity encapsulates a set of [Cloud Access](/reference/identity#cloud-access-universal-cloud-identity) rules. [Cloud Access](/reference/identity#cloud-access-universal-cloud-identity) rules define least privilege policies governing access to resources in the [org's](/reference/org) configured [cloud accounts](/reference/cloudaccount). In addition to [Cloud Access](/reference/identity#cloud-access-universal-cloud-identity) rules, an [identity](/reference/identity) also defines a set of [Network Resources](/reference/identity#network-resources-cloud-wormhole).

## Examples

- To allow a user or group access to perform actions within the console, an administrator would create a [policy](/reference/policy) that bounds the user or group to the resource and the necessary permissions.

- To allow a [workload](workload) the ability to access secured resources within Control Plane (e.g., a secret used as an environment variable), an administrator creates a [policy](/reference/policy) that assigns the necessary permissions to the user or group for the specified resource.
