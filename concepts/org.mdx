title: Org (Organization)

## Overview

An Org is a strictly isolated bounded context that encapsulates all the resources managed by Control Plane. These kinds of resources include [domains](/reference/domain), [images](/reference/image), [workloads](/concepts/workload), [GVCs](/reference/gvc), [users](/reference/user), [groups](/reference/group), [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount), etc.

A physical organization (e.g., Acme) can create more than one ‘org’, although it is optional. Reasons for
doing so might be to provide absolute isolation between subsidiaries for example.

<Note>An org name is **globally unique**</Note>

As a user of Control Plane, you will be a member of at least one organization and have access to manage the org resources listed below:
