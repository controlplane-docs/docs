## Step One - Log in

1. Browse to: [https://console.cpln.io](https://console.cpln.io)
2. The login page will be displayed:
   - Select the single sign-on (SSO) provider that is connected to your email address.
   - If prompted, enter your email address and password.
   - You will now be logged into the console.

## Step Two - Create a GVC

In this step, you will create a [GVC](/reference/gvc) and map it to two cloud providers
in two locations.

If you are not already on the `Create GVC` form, click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `GVC`.

1. Enter a [GVC](/reference/gvc) name (e.g., foo-bar-gvc) and click `Next (Locations)`.

2. Select the desired locations. For this quickstart, we'll select:

   - `aws-eu-central-1`
   - `gcp-us-east1`

3. Click `Create`. The [GVC](/reference/gvc) will be created and the `Info` page will be shown.
