Follow the steps below to configure log shipping to Stackdriver.

## Step 1 - Credential Procurement

GCP credentials are required to ship logs to Stackdriver.

To obtain GCP credentials and store it, follow the guide here: [GCP key](/reference/secret#google-cloud-platform-gcp)

## Step 2 - Configure External Logging

External logging can be configured by using either the [UI Console](#enable-logging-using-the-ui-console) or [CLI](#enable-logging-using-the-cli).

<TIP>Use a valid GCP location for the `location` field. E.g. us-east1</TIP>

### Enable Logging using the UI Console

1. From the Control Plane Console UI, click on `Org` in the left menu.
2. Click `External Logs` in the middle context menu.
3. Select `Stackdriver` and fill out the required fields.
4. Select the GCP secret created to authenticate to GCP. Refer to the [credential procurement](#step-1-credential-procurement) section to obtain and configure the necessary credentials.
5. Click `Save`.
6. After the configuration is complete, log entries will be available at Stackdriver within a few minutes.

### Enable Logging using the CLI

The external logging configuration can be created / updated using the CLI's `cpln org patch ORG_NAME -f FILE.yaml` command.

Below is an example Org manifests (in YAML). Edit and save the YAML as a file and use it as an input to the CLI's `cpln org patch ORG_NAME -f FILE.yaml` command.

Refer to the [credential procurement](#step-1-credential-procurement) section to obtain and configure the necessary credentials.

- Substitute: ORG_NAME, GCP_SECRET and possibly the location.

```yaml YAML
kind: org
name: ORG_NAME
spec:
  logging:
    stackdriver:
      location: us-east1
      credentials: //secret/GCP_SECRET
```
