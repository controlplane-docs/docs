## Overview

Control Plane offers the following single sign-on (SSO) providers for authenticating users:

- Google
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

After successful authentication, users' access privileges are determined based on their assigned [group membership](/reference/group) or [policy](/reference/policy).

## Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Configuration

To enable SAML authentication for your organization in Control Plane, you will need the assistance of our support team.

Please contact us on Slack or at [support@controlplane.com](mailto:support@controlplane.com) to schedule a configuration session.

The following values must be obtained from your authentication provider:

- Entity ID
- SSO URL
- Certificate

SAML configuration values:

- Service Provider Entity ID: `cpln.io`
- Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) / Callback URL: `https://console.cpln.io/__/auth/handler`
