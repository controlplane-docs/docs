## Overview

Locations show the available geographical locations for each of the following cloud providers:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure

Locations are scoped to an [org](/objects/org) and the org administrator can turn off/on the locations that are permitted when configuring a [GVC](/objects/gvc).

By default, all locations are enabled. If a location is disabled, any [workloads](/objects/workload) within that location will be removed. Further, if a location is enabled, all workloads will be provisioned to that location.

<Note>

If a company is restricted for legal or compliance reasons to only use certain cloud providers, disabling those providers will ensure that workloads will not be deployed to those providers.

</Note>

## Locations

Control Plane can enable any cloud provider location.

If a location is not shown, please email [support@controlplane.com](mailto:support@controlplane.com) with the provider and location and it will be provisioned.

## BYOK Locations

BYOK (Bring Your Own Kubernetes) enables you to add new locations by registering your own Kubernetes clusters as locations in the Control Plane.
For a guide on how to create new BYOK locations and further details, [refer to the BYOK documentation](/self-hosted/byok/overview).

## Built-in Tags

Each location has the following built-in [tags](/common-configs/tags):

- `cpln/city=VALUE`
- `cpln/country=VALUE`
- `cpln/continent=VALUE`

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/objects/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/platform/access-control):

| Permission | Description                              | Implies                                 |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| create     | Create new locations                     |                                         |
| delete     | Delete byok locations                    |                                         |
| edit       | Modify existing locations                | view                                    |
| manage     | Full access                              | create, delete, edit, manage, use, view |
| use        | Use this location for workload placement | view                                    |
| view       | Read-only access                         |                                         |
