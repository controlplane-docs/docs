## Overview

A group is a membership collection that can contain [users](/reference/user) and [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount). It is one of the [principal types](/platform/access-control) of an [org](/reference/org).

Membership in a group for a user account can be assigned directly or dynamically using a [query](/platform/query). For example, a query can be created to dynamically assign all the users that log in using `microsoft.com` by using the built-in tag key `firebase/sign_in_provider` equals `microsoft.com`.

Membership in a group for a service account can only be assigned directly.

Groups can contain an unlimited amount of users or service accounts.

Groups can be used by [policies](/objects/policy) to grant access permissions to the group members.

## Built-in Groups

Each org has the following built-in groups:

| Group Name | Description                                               |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| superusers | Built-in group for all administrators of the organization |
| viewers    | Built-in group for read-only access                       |

## Identity Matcher

A matcher can be configured that uses either JMESPath or Javascript expressin. It executes the expression against the users' claims to decide whether a user belongs to this group.
This method is useful for managing the grouping of users logged-in with SAML providers.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission | Description            | Implies                            |
| :--------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| create     | Create new groups      |                                    |
| delete     | Delete a group         |                                    |
| edit       | Modify existing groups | view                               |
| manage     | Full access            | create, delete, edit, manage, view |
| view       | Read-only view         |                                    |
