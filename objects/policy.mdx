## Overview

A policy governs resource access within an [org](/objects/org) to a set of principals. It enables fine-grained authorization rules to define the minimum amount of permissions required when accessing resources of the platform.

A policy consists of:

- A resource, and
- One or more bindings

### Resource

A resource is a Control Plane object (e.g., [secret](/objects/secret), [workload](/objects/workload), [GVC](/objects/gvc), etc.).

A policy can be configured to target all or specific resources within your org.

For example, a policy can target all the GVCs within your org, or specifically GVC A and GVC B.

Specific resources can be assigned directly or dynamically (using a [query](/platform/query)).

### Bindings

A binding is a mapping between:

- A set of permissions (e.g., create, delete, etc.), and
- Principal membership

The [set of permissions](#permissions) that can be assigned to a policy are unique to each resource.

Principals can be [users](/objects/user), [groups](/objects/group), [service accounts](/objects/serviceaccount), and [identities](/objects/identity).

## Examples

- Allow a user or a group access to the console
- Allow a service account to execute CLI commands
- Allow an identity access to reveal a secret. The identity can then be associated with a workload. The workload's containers will have permissions to access the secret and use it as an environment variable.

## Resource Permissions

Each resource has a set of permissions that can be assigned to a policy.

Expand the dropdown below and click on a resource to view their assignable permissions.

## Built-in Policies

Each org has the following built-in policies for each resource (agent, GVC, etc.):

| Policy Name         | Description                                                    | Target    | Permission | Group                                        | Service Account                                                   |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| superusers-RESOURCE | Built-in policy granting full access to the superusers group   | All Items | manage     | [superusers](/objects/group#built-in-groups) | [controlplane](/objects/serviceaccount#built-in-service-accounts) |
| viewers-RESOURCE    | Built-in policy granting read-only access to the viewers group | All Items | view       | [viewers](/objects/group#built-in-groups)    | none                                                              |

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define policies together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/platform/access-control):

| Permission | Description              | Implies                            |
| :--------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| create     | Create new policies      |                                    |
| delete     | Delete existing policies |                                    |
| edit       | Modify existing policies | view                               |
| manage     | Full access              | create, delete, edit, manage, view |
| view       | Read-only view           |                                    |
