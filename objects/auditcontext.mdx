title: 'Audit Context'
---

## Overview

Control Plane exposes a tamper-proof audit trail service for both Control Plane and custom workload actions.

To use this feature, a unique **Audit Context** needs to be created for your workload.

The audit context named `cpln` already exists to audit the actions that occur while using Control Plane.

Please refer to the [audit trail](/platform/audit-trail) reference page for additional details on how to query the audit trail and how to securely capture actions for your workloads.

## Default `cpln` audit context

Every org has a default audit context item named `cpln`, which keeps track of all the changes, including create and delete actions of all objects.
