title: 'Cloud Account'

## Overview

A **cloud account** is a mapping between your [org](/reference/org) and a cloud provider. When creating a cloud account, instructions are provided on how to create a bridge account at the cloud provider with minimum access permissions. This bridge account is used by Control Plane to query and manage the necessary resources at the cloud provider on behalf of your [org](/reference/org).

Cloud accounts are scoped to an [org](/reference/org) and are used in conjunction with [identities](/reference/identity) to set up [cloud access](/reference/identity#cloud-access-universal-cloud-identity) rules.

Your [workload](/concepts/workload) can then be associated with an [identity](/reference/identity) and will then have the ability to call any of the allowed cloud provider resources transparently without any additional set up.

For example, if your application uses AWS S3 for storage and Azure Cosmos DB for its database, your workload will be able to access both no matter which [location](/reference/location) the workload is deployed to. The [workload](/concepts/workload) calls each resource as if it had a direct connection and the [identity](/reference/identity) will route the request seamlessly to the proper location.

## Azure Details

When registering a cloud account targeting Azure, you can choose from the following methods:

- [Azure SDK](#azure-sdk)
  - Access tokens are minted using an Azure Service Principal.
- [Azure Connector](#azure-connector)
  - An [Azure Function App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)
    acts as a bridge that calls internals Azure APIs to obtain access tokens.

<Tip>

During the creation of an Azure cloud account, the Azure CLI generates credentials that are used by Control Plane when connecting to Azure to provision apps or user identities that will be used by workload identities. These credentials are uploaded and stored securely as an [Azure-SDK secret](/reference/secret#azure-sdk) or [Azure-Connector secret](/reference/secret#azure-connector) and can be viewed by clicking `Secrets` from the left menu in the console after creating an Azure cloud account.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission | Description                    | Implies                                    |
| :--------- | :----------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| browse     | Browse account contents        | view                                       |
| create     | Create new cloud accounts      |                                            |

| edit       | Modify existing cloud accounts | view, browse                               |
| manage     | Full access                    | browse, create, delete, edit, manage, view |
| view       | Read-only access               |                                            |
