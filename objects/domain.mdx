## Overview

[Workloads](/concepts/workload) managed at Control Plane can be configured to serve requests using any domain name you own.

Domains are scoped to an [Org](/reference/org) and are associated with **one** [GVC](/reference/gvc). The domain can then be configured to handle requests for one or multiple [Workloads](/concepts/workload) within that [GVC](/reference/gvc).

Domains that are configured at Control Plane are automatically secured using TLS certificates, load balanced, and DNS geo-routed to the nearest healthy [location](/reference/location) assigned to the [GVC](/reference/gvc).

## Default Domain Names

If a Domain is not mapped to a [GVC](/reference/gvc), the default domain names provided to [Workloads](/concepts/workload) are:

// TODO mention here that gvc mapped domain is a legacy method, can have it's own section here

- Canonical endpoints (Global): `cpln.app` // TODO explain it is `{workloadName}-{gvcAlias}.cpln.app`
- Individual location endpoints: `controlplane.us` // TODO explain it is `{workloadName}-{gvcAlias}.{location}.controlplane.us`

## Domain Verification

An apex domain, also known as a root domain, refers to a domain name that does not have any subdomain prefix (e.g., **example.com**).

Even if the apex domain isn't served at Control Plane, it needs to be created and configured for verification. This verification is done by adding a TXT record to DNS.

Once the apex domain is verified, subdomains can be added to the same [Org](/reference/org) without needing the TXT record verification step.

If multiple [Orgs](/reference/org) are creating subdomains using the same apex domain, the apex domain verification only needs to be performed in one of the Orgs, but subdomains in Orgs that don't have the apex domain will require a TXT record be added to DNS for verification.

<Tip>As a best practice, create the apex domain in the Org designated for your production environment.</Tip>

## Hostname Behavior

// TODO explain and give examples, why don't we have HOST variable when we connect to a replica?

The hostname (`HOST`) environment variable that will be set on a running workload will be based on the type of Workload and which domain was used for the request.

For **serverless** workloads, even if the request was served using a custom domain, the hostname will be the canonical name.

For **standard** or **stateful** workloads, the hostname will be set to the name of domain used for the request.

## Routing Modes

Control Plane provides two routing modes for directing requests to your domain:

1. [Path Based Routing](#path-based-routing)
2. [Subdomain Based Routing](#subdomain-based-routing)

### Path Based Routing

Path based routing allows requests to a specific path prefix be routed to a specific workload. Multiple paths can be defined, but there must be at least one path.

This is accomplished by adding a **CNAME** record to DNS.

Advantages of using Path Based routing:

- You maintain full control of DNS for the domain.
- CDN / WAF Compatible.

**Example URL endpoints:**

- If the domain `sub.example.com` is configured to point to the GVC that contains `workload_one` and `workload_two`. The path `workload_one` can be configured to route requests to `workload_one` and the path `workload_two` can be configured route requests to `workload_two`.
  - **https://sub.example.com/workload_one**
  - **https://sub.example.com/workload_two**

<Note>All path prefix values must be unique and there must be at least one path defined.</Note>

#### Path Prefix Replacement

A path prefix can be configured to be replaced when forwarding the request to the [Workload](/concepts/workload).

**For example:** A request to the URL `https://sub.example.com/users/` can have the path prefix `/users/` replaced with the path prefix `/v2/users/`
when forwarding the request internally to the target [Workload](/concepts/workload).

<Note>This does not work for regex-based paths</Note>

#### Root Path Prefix

The `/` path will match any unmatched path prefixes for the subdomain.

#### Path Order

The order of the path prefix list is adjustable. When a request to the Domain is received, the first match will be processed.

<Note>

When combining the `/` path prefix with other path prefixes, the `/` path will automatically be placed last in the list because it matches
ALL requests.

</Note>

#### Port Selection

Each route can have a port assigned which will route requests to the respective port at the running workload.

For **serverless** workloads, assigning the port is optional since only one port can serve traffic.

For **standard** and **stateful** workloads that serve traffic on multiple ports, specific ports can be assigned on a route. If no port is assigned, external requests will be routed to the first port configured on the container. TODO does this mean we actually have an ordered list in the ports?

<Note>

When a domain is serving path based requests, the [domain port protocol](#protocol) must be compatible with the selected protocol of the
port configured on the container. (i.e., HTTP2 is compatible with HTTP2 and GRPC, HTTP is compatible with HTTP, etc.)

</Note>

// TODO create a table for above compatibilities

// TODO for all examples above, create tables

### Regex Based Routing

Instead of specifying routes based on a path prefix, paths can be specified using [regex](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

**For example:** A path regex can be specified as: `/user/.*/profile` to match routes like: `/user/bob/profile` or `/user/mary/profile`

<Note>If at least one regex path is found, routes will not be sorted.</Note>

### Subdomain Based Routing

Subdomain based routing allows a domain to be mapped to all workloads in a [GVC](/reference/gvc).

The is accomplished by adding **NS** records to DNS which delegate DNS to Control Plane for this domain **only**.

Advantages of using Subdomain routing:

- Best choice when a unique DNS subdomain is required for each workload.
- One-time configuration.
- Works for all current and future workloads in a GVC.

**Example URL endpoints:**

- If the domain `sub.example.com` is configured to the GVC that contains workloads named `workload_one` and `workload_two`, Control Plane will create
  the following subdomains and route requests to the respective workloads:
  - **https://workload_one.sub.example.com**
  - **https://workload_two.sub.example.com**

// TODO make above a table

## APEX Domain Considerations

- An apex domain (e.g., **example.com**) can serve requests to Workloads using
  either [path based](#path-based-routing) or [subdomain based](#subdomain-based-routing) routing.

- If subdomain based routing is desired, a [Custom Server Certificate](#custom-server-certificate) must be configured.

- If your DNS provider does not allow apex domains to point to a CNAME record, a service such as [CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/index.html) or [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) must be used to proxy the apex domain to Control Plane.

<Tip>

These DNS providers **do not** allow apex domains to have a CNAME record:

- GoDaddy
- Route53

</Tip>

## Port Configuration

Using the UI console, the port configuration section can be accessed when editing a domain and using `Advanced Mode`.

// TODO remove, do not mention ui

### External Port

Typically, TLS requests to a configured domain are served on the standard TLS port 443.

Refer to the [dedicated load balancer](#dedicated-load-balancer-options) section on which external ports can be used if dedicated load balancing is enabled.

### Protocol

The following protocols are supported:

1. **HTTP2**
1. **HTTP**
1. **TCP** (when using a [dedicated load balancer](#dedicated-load-balancer-options))

### TLS Settings

The default TLS protocol version is **1.2**. The minimum TLS protocol version is **1.0**.

The minimum version should be set as high as possible and all modern browsers support the default of **1.2**.

#### Cipher Suites

// TODO explain or reference what these are, give maybe also prefixed groups for different purposes

The following cipher suites are added by default and can be removed / re-added:

1. ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
1. ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
1. ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
1. ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
1. ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305
1. ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
1. AES256-GCM-SHA384
1. AES128-GCM-SHA256

Additional ciphers which can be added:

1. DES-CBC3-SHA
1. ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA
1. ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
1. AES128-SHA
1. AES256-SHA

If you need additional cipher suites, please contact support on Slack or email [support@controlplane.com](mailto:support@controlplane.com).

<Tip>

If there is an attempt to disable the TLS settings on a domain, it will always revert to the default configuration unless the domain is using a non-standard port and a non-HTTP protocol (e.g., using TCP with a [dedicated load balancer](#dedicated-load-balancer-options)).

</Tip>

// TODO for above, there can also be a compatibility table here

#### Client Certificate Forwarding

Client certificates included in a request to a Domain can be configured to be forwarded to the destination [Workload](/concepts/workload).

The `x-forwarded-client-cert` (XFCC) HTTP header will contain the client certificate details.

The certificate authority PEM, stored as a [TLS Secret](/reference/secret#tls), can be associated with the Domain and used to verify the authority of the client certificate. The only verification performed checks that the CN of the PEM matches the Domain (i.e., **CN=\*.DOMAIN**).

If a certificate authority PEM is not associated with a Domain, no verification is performed.

CRL lists are not verified / checked, but they can be checked by the [Workload](/concepts/workload) by keeping a list of allowed or revoked client certificate hashes. When a request is received by the [Workload](/concepts/workload), the hash field in the XFCC header can be checked against the allowed or revoked list and an allow / deny decision can be made.

To generate the certificate hash, execute the following command:

```bash
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in MyClientCert.pem | awk -F= '{print $2}' | tr -d ':' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`
```

<Tip>

Verify that the CA certificate includes the correct x509 key usage fields (critical, digitalSignature, keyEncipherment) + extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth and that the CN of the client certificate matches the domain name selected.

</Tip>

#### Custom Server Certificate

A Custom Server Certificate can be assigned to a Domain by selecting an exisiting [TLS secret](/reference/secret#tls).

This certificate is used when configuring:

1. An apex domain that is configured with [subdomain based routing](#subdomain-based-routing).
2. A domain that is fronted by a proxy (such as CloudFlare).
3. A domain that prefers not to use a certificate generated by Control Plane.

<Tip>

If a custom server certificate is configured on a domain, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the certificate is valid and not expired.

</Tip>

### CORS Settings

**CORS** stands for **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**. It is a mechanism that allows web browsers to securely make requests to a different domain or origin than the one from which the web page was served.

By default, web browsers enforce a policy called the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts JavaScript code running in a web page from making requests to a different domain. CORS provides a way to relax this policy and enable cross-origin requests, but in a controlled and secure manner.

When a web page makes a cross-origin request, the server needs to include specific CORS headers in its response to indicate which origins are allowed to access its resources. These headers include information such as the allowed methods, allowed headers, and whether credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) can be included in the request.

CORS helps to prevent malicious scripts from performing unauthorized actions on behalf of a user, while still allowing legitimate cross-origin requests between trusted domains. It plays a crucial role in enabling modern web applications to interact with APIs and services hosted on different domains.

The following are CORS properties that are configurable on the domain. Depending on the application being served, these setting could be configured from the application.

The following CORS properties can be configured:

- **Allow Credentials**
  - Determines whether the client-side code (typically running in a web browser) is allowed to include credentials (such as cookies, HTTP authentication, or client-side SSL certificates) in cross-origin requests.
- **Max Age**
  - Maximum amount of time, in seconds, that a preflight request result can be cached by the client browser. (Default: 24 hours)
- **Allow Origins**
  - Determines which origins are allowed to access a particular resource on a server from a web browser.
    - Examples:
      - Wildcard Origin: `*`
      - Specific Origin: `https://example.com`
- **Allow Methods**
  - Specifies the HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that are allowed for a cross-origin request to a specific resource.
- **Allow Headers**
  - Specifies the custom HTTP headers that are allowed in a cross-origin request to a specific resource.
- **Expose Headers**
  - Specifies which response headers are exposed to the client-side code (typically running in a web browser) in a cross-origin request.

## Dedicated Load Balancer Options

When a GVC has the dedicated load balancer option enabled, additional settings are available for any domains using it.

See the [GVC dedicated load balancer](/reference/gvc#dedicated-load-balancer) reference page for additional details.

### NumTrustedProxies

This gives control over the number of trusted proxies that are configured in front of Control Plane.

Changing it, controls the source ip address used for request logging, firewall settings and for the X-Envoy-External-Address header passed to workloads.

If set to 1, then the last address in an existing X-Forwarded-For header will be used in place of the source client IP address.

If set to 2, then the second to last address in an existing X-Forwarded-For header will be used in place of the source client IP address.

When set to 2, any request where the XFF header does not have at least two addresses or does not exist then the source client IP address will be used instead.

### Custom Ports

The following external ports may be configured instead of only `443` and `80`.

- 1443
- 3000
- 3001
- 3002
- 3003
- 3004
- 5912
- 8443
- 8444
- 50051
- 50052

Please contact support on Slack or email [support@controlplane.com](mailto:support@controlplane.com) if you need to use a port that is not listed here.

### Configuration Options

When a dedicated load balancer is enabled on a GVC, the domains that are configured to serve workloads within that GVC will have the following options that can be configured:

1. [Accept All Hosts](#accept-all-hosts)
1. [Host Prefix](#host-prefix)

#### Accept All Hosts

`Accept All Hosts` configures the domain to allow all traffic (i.e. wildcard support) to the configured workloads, regardless of what the Host header or SNI is for the request.

#### Host Prefix

For domains using [Path Based Routing](#path-based-routing) the `Host Prefix` will be enabled and can be used for each path when the domain has the `Accept All Hosts` property enabled.

This option allows forwarding traffic for different host headers to specific workloads.

// TODO , for the above two, give examples

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission | Description                                        | Implies                                 |
