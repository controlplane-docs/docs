## Overview

Refer to the [Workload concepts](/concepts/workload) page.

## Create a Workload

Refer to the [Create a Workload](/guides/create-workload) guide for additional details.

## Access Report

Displays the permissions granted to principals for the workload.

## Identity

Refer to the [identities](/reference/identity) page for additional details.

## Connect

A specific replica of a workload can be connected to (similar to `exec`) from either the console or the CLI. This can be used for troubleshooting any issues with the replica.

To connect using the console, click the `Connect` link from a workload. Select the location, container, replica, and command. Click `Connect` to execute the command. By default, the `bash` shell will be executed.

To connect using the CLI, review the workload [connect](/reference/cli#workload-connect) subcommand.

## Debug

In order to see detailed routing for the global georouted endpoint of a workload, debug values can be included within the response headers of a workload's endpoint request.

The values will only be returned when:

1. `debug` is active and the header `x-cpln-debug: true` is in the request.
2. The global or canonical endpoint is being requested.

Using the console, debug can be activated by:

- Clicking `Options`.
- Clicking the `Debug` switch to `on`.
- Clicking `Save`.

After the workload redeploys, the response from the workload's endpoint will contain the following headers if the header `x-cpln-debug: true` is in the request:

- `x-cpln-location`: Location of the responding replica.
- `x-cpln-replica`: Name of the responding replica.

```text Sample Request Headers

```

## Endpoints

### Canonical Endpoint (global)

This URL is globally load-balanced and TLS terminated. This can be used for testing if there is an issue with the custom domain that is associated with the [GVC](/reference/gvc).

### Location Specific Endpoint

Within each deployment, a location specific URL is available that can be used for testing how your app is responding from a specific location of a [GVC](/reference/gvc).

### Custom Domain Endpoints

Additional globally load-balanced endpoints will show in the workload status for each domain route that is configured to use this workload.

### Internal Mutual-TLS Endpoint

Format: `$workloadName.$gvcName.cpln.local:$port`

Each workload can be allowed to receive requests from other workloads in the same Org internally using the provided internal endpoint. Access to this endpoint is controlled by the internal firewall settings.


## Inter-Container Communication

Containers deployed within the same workload can communicate with each other using their names and assigned ports. This setup facilitates direct networking between containers.

- **Container Identification** - Each container is uniquely identified by its name.
- **Port Allocation** - Containers are assigned specific ports for network communication.

### Example Scenario

- Imagine two containers within the same workload: `foo` and `bar`.
- Container `foo` is running on port **4020**.
- Container `bar` is running on port **4030**.

`foo` can access `bar` using the URL **http://bar:4030**. This URL combines the name of the destination container `bar` and its assigned port **4030**, enabling direct communication between the two containers.

This method ensures efficient and organized networking within a multi-container workload environment.


## Built-in Variables

Each workload has the following built-in environment variables:

| Variable Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                 | Format                                           |

<Note>

Since a Workload Identity can be the target of a Policy, a running Workload can be authorized to exercise the
Control Plane [CLI](/reference/cli) or [API](/api-reference/api) without any additional authentication.

Examples:

- Direct call to the Control Plane API:

  - `curl ${CPLN_ENDPOINT}/org/${CPLN_ORG} -H "Authorization: ${CPLN_TOKEN}"`

- If the Control Plane CLI installed:
  - `cpln org get ${CPLN_ORG}`

** The value of CPLN_TOKEN is valid only if the request originates from the Workload it is injected in. If it is used from another Workload or externally, a `403 Forbidden` response will be returned. **

</Note>

<Tip>

If a Workload is not assigned an Identity, it can still `GET` its parent Org.

## Logs

Workload logs are consolidated from all the deployed locations and can be viewed using the UI or CLI.

Using the UI, the logs page will be prefilled with the [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/)
query for the workload and [GVC](/reference/gvc) name.

```log Example LogQL Query
  {gvc="test-gvc", workload="test-workload"}
```

Logs can be further filtered by:

- `Date`
- `Location`
- `Container`

Grafana can be used to view the logs by clicking the `Explore on Grafana` link within the console.

Refer to the [logs](/reference/logs) page for additional details.


## Rollout Options

Settings to control the rollout process between versions.

```yaml YAML
spec:
  rolloutOptions:
    minReadySeconds: 0
    maxUnavailableReplicas: 1
    maxSurgeReplicas: 100%
    scalingPolicy: OrderedReady
```

#### minReadySeconds

The minimum number of seconds that a workload replica must be running before the rollout progresses.

#### maxUnavailableReplicas

The maximum number or percentage of replicas that can be unavailable during a rollout or during regular rescheduling of workloads.

#### maxSurgeReplicas

The maximum number or percentage of new replicas that can added during a rollout for each batch.

Example: If there are 4 running replicas and maxSurgeReplicas is set to 50%, then during each rollout 2 replicas will be added at the new version. Once they are healthy as determined by the [ReadinessProbe](#readiness-probe), the rollout will continue, -2 old replicas, +2 new replicas, -2 old replicas.

In cases where a short rollout cutover is needed, a maxSurgeReplicas setting of `100%` is recommended.

#### scalingPolicy

The strategies used to update applications and services deployed. Valid values: `OrderedReady` (Updates workloads in a rolling fashion, taking down old ones and bringing up new ones incrementally, ensuring that the service remains available during the update.), `Parallel` (Causes all pods affected by a scaling operation to be created or destroyed simultaneously. This does not affect update operations.). Default: `OrderedReady`.

## Default Ephemeral Storage

Each workload replica receives at least 1GB of local ephemeral solid state drive (SSD) storage. Workloads that request more than 1 core of CPU receive 1GB of storage for each core. For example, a workload that requests 1500 millicore of CPU can consume up to 1.5GB of ephemeral storage.

If the replica uses more than its allotted ephemeral storage, it will be replaced with a new replica.

## Suspend

Each workload can be suspended which immediately stops the workload from serving traffic. This is the same as setting the min/max scale to 0. When the workload is unsuspended, it will resume serving traffic.

To temporarily deactivate a workload choose `Stop` from the Actions menu.

```yaml YAML
spec:
  defaultOptions:
    suspend: true
```

The workload will stop running and will not serve any traffic.

To reactivate the workload, choose `Start` from the actions menu.

```yaml YAML
spec:
  defaultOptions:
    suspend: false
```

## Timeout

The maximum request duration in seconds before Control Plane will timeout. This timeout amount can be reached when Control Plane is waiting for the workload to respond or when waiting for a new workload to become available when using Autoscaling.

The minimum value is **1 second** and the maximum value is **600 seconds**.


### Metering and Billing

The CPU, memory and egress used for mounted object stores are billed to the workload. To review the costs of mounting an object store, query the container named `cpln-mounter` for the workload within the metrics page.

## Workload Health

- Possible values:
  - `Loading`
  - `Healthy`
  - `Unhealthy`
  - `Deleting`
  - `Unknown`
