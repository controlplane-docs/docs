title: Firewall
---

<Info>

Inbound network access is only available for workloads of types `serverless` and `standard`. For other workload types, only outbound firewall settings are relevant.

</Info>

## External

The external firewall is used to control Internet traffic to/from a workload.

```yaml YAML
spec:
  firewallConfig:
    external:
      inboundAllowCIDR:
        - 1.2.3.0/24
      outboundAllowCIDR:
        - 1.2.3.0/24
      outboundAllowHostname:
        - example.com
      outboundAllowPort:
        - protocol: http
          number: 80
      inboundBlockedCIDR:
        - 1.2.3.4/32
      outboundBlockedCIDR:
        - 1.2.3.4/32
```

### Inbound Requests

- By default, all inbound requests are disabled.
- Access is granted by explicitly adding one or more IPv4 / IPv6 / [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) addresses or allowing all addresses.
- Some CIDR values can be blocked, it will override any allowed values.
- Using the UI:
  - Multiple address can entered within the textbox by delimiting each address with either a comma or space.
  - An import file can be uploaded containing each address on its own line or delimited with either a comma or space.

<Tip>

The CIDR address `0.0.0.0/0` allows full inbound access from the public Internet.

</Tip>

### Outbound Requests

- By default, all outbound requests are disabled.
- By default, or by specifying NO outbound ports, all are ALLOWED.
- When outbound ports are specified, only traffic to those ports will be allowed.
- Access is granted by explicitly adding one or more IPv4 / IPv6 / [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) addresses or public hostnames or allowing all addresses / hostnames.
  - **When using a hostname, only ports 80, 443, and 445 will be reachable. To allow all ports, enable all outbound requests.**
  - When using a IP or CIDR, all ports will be reachable.
- The IP/CIDR addresses takes precedence over hostnames.
- Using the UI:
  - Multiple address can entered within the textbox by delimiting each address with either a comma or space.
  - An import file can be uploaded containing each address on its own line or delimited with either a comma or space.

<Tip>

The CIDR address `0.0.0.0/0` allows full outbound access to the public Internet.

</Tip>

### Blocked Addresses

All addresses specified will be blocked from outbound/inbound requests to/from this workload

```yaml YAML
spec:
  firewallConfig:
    external:
      inboundBlockedCIDR:
        - 1.2.3.4/32
      outboundBlockedCIDR:
        - 1.2.3.4/32
```

- Blocking an address has the same effect as not including it in the allow CIDR list

## Internal

The internal firewall is used to control access between other workloads within an [org](/objects/org). Only the ports listed in the workload containers array will be made accessible to other workloads.

```yaml YAML
spec:
  firewallConfig:
    internal:
      inboundAllowType: same-gvc
```

**Available Options:**

- `none`: No access is allowed between workloads.
- `same-gvc`: Workloads running in the same [GVC](/objects/gvc) are accessible.
- `same-org`: Workloads running in the same [org](/objects/org) are accessible.
- `workload-list`: Specific workloads are allowed access this workload.
  - These workloads can be from the same or different GVCs.
  - The user configuring this setting must have the `view` permission, set within a [policy](/objects/policy#permissions), on the workload being specified.
  - Use `inboundAllowWorkload` to list out the allowed workloads, by their links
