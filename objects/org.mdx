## Overview

An Org serves as a tightly isolated bounded context that encompasses all the resources managed by Control Plane. These resources comprise [domains](/reference/domain), [images](/reference/image), [workloads](/concepts/workload), [GVCs](/reference/gvc), [users](/reference/user), [groups](/reference/group), [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount), and more.

It's possible for a physical organization, to create multiple 'orgs,' although this is not mandatory. Creating multiple orgs can be beneficial in order to establish complete isolation between environments, for instance.

## Overview 2

An Org is a strictly isolated bounded context that encapsulates all the resources managed by Control Plane. These kinds of resources include [domains](/reference/domain), [images](/reference/image), [workloads](/concepts/workload), [GVCs](/reference/gvc), [users](/reference/user), [groups](/reference/group), [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount), etc.

A physical organization (e.g., Acme) can create more than one ‘org’, although it is optional. Reasons for
doing so might be to provide absolute isolation between subsidiaries for example.

As a user of Control Plane, you will be a member of at least one organization and have access to manage the org resources listed below:

## Multiple Orgs

A user can be a member of one or more Orgs.

- To switch between Orgs from the console:
  - From the left menu, click on the `>` to the right of the current org.
  - Search or scroll to the desired org.
  - Click on the desired org.
  - A confirmation modal will be displayed. Click `Yes`.

## External Logs / Logging

TODO explain here briefly each provider, refer to guides
TODO mentione the log rate limitation here and for each provider if different

Control Plane offers the ability to ship all Org logs to an external provider.

Please [click here](/external-logging/overview) for additional details and configuration instructions.

## Tracing

OpenTelemetry traces are supported and can be configured with the native `Control Plane` tracing provider or sent to an OpenTelemetry collector endpoint by using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

### Control Plane Tracing Provider

The Control Plane tracing provider is the default method for collecting OpenTelemetry traces. They will be accessible for exploration using Grafana by accessing `Metrics` in the sidebar menu of the Console.

To enable traces using the Console, navigate to your GVC, click on `Tracing`, and choose `Control Plane` as the metric provider. Then, configure the sampling percentage and, optionally, the Custom Tags.

Here is an example of a GVC with enabled tracing:

```yaml YAML
kind: gvc
name: online-boutique
spec:
  staticPlacement:
    locationLinks:
      - //location/aws-eu-central-1
      - //location/azure-eastus2
      - //location/gcp-us-west1
  tracing:
    provider:
      controlPlane: {}
    customTags: {}
    sampling: 100
```

### OpenTelemetry Tracing Provider

Similarly, traces can be sent to an OTEL collector endpoint using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

For details, see the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/controlplane-com/examples/blob/main/examples/online-boutique/README.md) example.

## Observability

The retention period for logs, metrics and traces defaults to 30 days and can be adjusted for each independently.

Charges apply for combined storage of logs, metrics and traces over 100GB calculated by GB-Month.

TODO mention free tier

## Threat Detection

Control Plane provides real-time threat detection and alerting by inspecting syscalls of all running workloads.
When enabled, you will receive real-time alerts of possible threats by severity level.

The following list of threats or attempted activities will trigger an alert at the specified severity levels.

#### Notice severity

- Packet socket created
- PTRACE anti-debug
- SSH Activity
- Connect to kubernetes api

#### Info severity

- Spawned processes with an interactive tty

#### Warning severity

- Directory traversal
- Sensitive file read activity
- Netcat remote code execution
- Search for private keys or passwords
- Log file clearing
- Remove data from disk
- Create symlinks\hardlinks to sensitive files
- Kernel module injection
- Debugfs activity
- PTRACE attached
- Credential search activity
- Execution from /dev/shm
- Malicious binaries or script execution

#### Critical severity

- Container escape attempts
- Drop and execute new binary
- Fileless execution using memfd_create
- Crypto currency mining activity

## Session Timeout - Console UI

The console UI will automatically sign out if inactive for 15 minutes. This timeout duration is the
default setting (for [PCI compliance](/compliance#pci)) and can be modified.

This timeout setting (in seconds) can be adjusted from the `Info` page when clicking on the `Org` link from the left menu.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission       | Description                                                                    | Implies                                                                                               |
