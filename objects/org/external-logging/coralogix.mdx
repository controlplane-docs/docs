## Overview

[Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/) is a log management and analytics platform designed to simplify log data storage, analysis, and visualization. It offers various features that make it an excellent choice for storing server logs.

Using Coralogix to store server logs can streamline your log management process, providing you with valuable insights into your server's performance, identifying potential issues early on, and improving overall application and system reliability.

Follow the steps below to configure log shipping to Coralogix.

## Step 1 - Credential Procurement

An API key is required to ship logs to Coralogix.

Follow these steps to obtain the API key, store it as an [Opaque Secret](/objects/secret#opaque), and
configure external logging.

1. From the Coralogix Dashboard, click the `Data Flow` link (in the header), then click the `API Keys` link.
2. Generate and/or copy the `Send Your Data` API Key.
3. From the Control Plane Console UI, click `Secrets` from the left menu.
4. Click the `New` button.
5. Enter a `Name` for the secret, and select `Opaque` from the Secret Type list.
6. Paste the string from step #2 into the content text box and click `Save`.
7. This secret will be used when configuring logging using the [UI Console](#enable-logging-using-the-ui-console) or [CLI](#enable-logging-using-the-cli).

## Step 2 - Configure External Logging

External logging can be configured by using either the [UI Console](#enable-logging-using-the-ui-console) or [CLI](#enable-logging-using-the-cli).

### Enable Logging using the UI Console

1. From the Control Plane Console UI, click on `Org` in the left menu.
2. Click `External Logs` in the middle context menu.
3. Select `Coralogix` and fill out the required fields.
4. Select the Opaque secret created to authenticate to Coralogix. Refer to the [credential procurement](#step-1-credential-procurement) section to obtain and configure the necessary credentials.
5. Click `Save`.
6. After the configuration is complete, log entries will be available at Coralogix within a few minutes.

<Tip>The cluster name will be the domain name that resolves when using the Coralogix dashboard.</Tip>

### Enable Logging using the CLI

The external logging configuration can be created / updated using the CLI's `cpln org patch ORG_NAME -f FILE.yaml` command.

Below is an example Org manifests (in YAML). Edit and save the YAML as a file and use it as an input to the CLI's `cpln org patch ORG_NAME -f FILE.yaml` command.

Refer to the [credential procurement](#step-1-credential-procurement) section to obtain and configure the necessary credentials.

- Substitute: `ORG_NAME`, `OPAQUE_SECRET`, and possibly the cluster.

<Note>

Use the cluster URL that matches your Coralogix account. The cluster will be the domain name that resolves when using the Coralogix dashboard.

</Note>

```yaml YAML
kind: org
name: ORG_NAME
spec:
  logging:
    coralogix:
      cluster: coralogix.com
      credentials: //secret/OPAQUE_SECRET
```
