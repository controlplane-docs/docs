## Overview

A Global Virtual Cloud ([GVC](/reference/gvc)) defines a set of cloud providers and their [locations](/reference/location).

When creating a GVC you are in essence building an uber-cloud that is comprised of the specified [locations](/reference/location). [Workloads](/concepts/workload) are deployed to the GVC which are then served from all the [locations](/reference/location) specified.

Each [org](/reference/org) can have multiple GVCs, each with its own unique set of [locations](/reference/location).

A [domain name](/reference/domain) can be assigned to a GVC. Callers can reach [workloads](/concepts/workload) using the assigned [domain name](/reference/domain).

## Benefits

- GVCs enable your [workload](/concepts/workload) to be deployed with ease to multiple cloud providers and locations
  - You choose the provider (AWS, Azure, and GCP) and their different locations
  - Select [locations](/reference/location) that are close to your end-users
  - Select the [locations](/reference/location) that fulfill the requirements of your workloads
  - Ensure maximum availability if a cloud provider has an occasional outage
- You get granular controls to define the scaling characteristics of your [workload](/concepts/workload)

## Domain Name

Each GVC can be set to use one of the fully qualified [domain names](/reference/domain) that have been mapped to an [org](/reference/org).

The selected [domain name](/reference/domain) will be used by all [workloads](/concepts/workload) when serving their containers.

The default domain name `cpln.app` will be used if an [org](/reference/org) does not have any domains configured, or if you do not select a [domain name](/reference/domain).

## Pull Secrets

Pull secrets are [secrets](/reference/secret) that are assigned to a GVC and used by [workloads](/concepts/workload) when authentication is required for pulling an image from a private registry. Only the [Docker](/reference/secret#docker), [Amazon ECR](/reference/secret#ecr), and [GCP](/reference/secret#google-cloud-platform-gcp) [secret](/reference/secret) types are supported.

<Tip>If the image was pushed to the Control Plane registry for the same [org](/reference/org), no secret is required.</Tip>

Multiple pull secrets can be assigned to a GVC. A [workload's container](/concepts/workload) will use the appropriate secret when pulling the image from a private registry. If there are multiple secrets, the container will cycle through each one.

If authentication fails, the deployment will not be updated and the image pull will have an exponential backoff retry starting at 10 seconds until 5 minutes (e.g., 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 40 seconds, etc.).

## Switching between GVCs

Using the console, if an [Org](/reference/org) has multiple GVCs, there will be an angle bracket `>` to the right of the current GVC name in the left menu. Click the bracket to show and select a GVC.

## GVC Namespace

The GVC namespace is used when constructing the canonical endpoint and individual location endpoints to avoid naming collision between workloads with the same name in different GVCs. The namespace is also used when performing [service-to-service](/guides/service-to-service) calls.

## GVC Locations

The cloud provider [locations](/reference/location) that [workloads](/concepts/workload) will be served from are mapped to a GVC. At least one location is required. The global and canonical endpoints will use DNS to route the request to the nearest healthy location.

<Note>Adding or removing a location will immediately provision or deprovision it from all workloads, respectively.</Note>

The available [locations](/reference/location) are scoped to an org and can be enabled/disabled globally. Any changes to the location at the org will be propagated to all GVCs using that location.

## Dedicated Load Balancer

When a dedicated load balancer is enabled on a GVC, all inbound traffic is routed through a custom cloud load balancer for each enabled location. Enabling/disabling this option can cause a brief period when connectivity fails during the period of DNS propagation.

Additional charges apply when custom load balancing is enabled.

Any [domains](/reference/domain) configured to route traffic to this GVC will also leverage the custom load balancer.

The following additional [domain](/reference/domain#dedicated-load-balancer-options) settings are available when using a custom load balancer:

1. [Custom Ports](/reference/domain#custom-ports) : Allows domains to route TCP traffic and can be configured on a variety of ports.
1. [Accept All Hosts](/reference/domain#accept-all-hosts) : Allows the domain to accept traffic for any hostname.

## Tracing

OpenTelemetry traces are supported and can be configured with the native `Control Plane` tracing provider or sent to an OpenTelemetry collector endpoint by using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

### Control Plane Tracing Provider

The Control Plane tracing provider is the default method for collecting OpenTelemetry traces. They will be accessible for exploration using Grafana by accessing `Metrics` in the sidebar menu of the Console.

To enable traces using the Console, navigate to your GVC, click on `Tracing`, and choose `Control Plane` as the metric provider. Then, configure the sampling percentage and, optionally, the Custom Tags.

Here is an example of a GVC with enabled tracing:

```yaml YAML
kind: gvc
name: online-boutique
spec:
  staticPlacement:
    locationLinks:
      - //location/aws-eu-central-1
      - //location/azure-eastus2
      - //location/gcp-us-west1
  tracing:
    provider:
      controlPlane: {}
    customTags: {}
    sampling: 100
```

### OpenTelemetry Tracing Provider

Similarly, traces can be sent to an OTEL collector endpoint using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

For details, see the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/controlplane-com/examples/blob/main/examples/online-boutique/README.md) example.

## Pull Secrets

Pull secrets are [secrets](/reference/secret) that are assigned to a GVC and used by [workloads](/concepts/workload) when authentication is required when pulling an image from a private registry.

Only [Docker](/reference/secret#docker), [Amazon ECR](/reference/secret#ecr), and [GCP](/reference/secret#google-cloud-platform-gcp) secrets types are supported for pull secrets.

<Tip>

If the image was pushed to the Control Plane registry for the same [Org](/reference/org), no pull secret is required when a workload pulls from the image from the same Org.

</Tip>

Multiple pull secrets can be assigned to a GVC. A [workload's container](/reference/workload/containers) will use the appropriate secret when pulling the image from a private registry. If there are multiple secrets, the container will cycle through each one.

If authentication fails, the deployment will not be updated and the image pull will have an exponential backoff retry starting at 10 seconds and ending at 5 minutes (e.g., 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 40 seconds, etc.).

## Environment Variables

You may set environment variables at the GVC level, which can then be inherited by any of the GVC's workloads. To inherit GVC environment variables, a container must have its `inheritEnv` property set to true. For more information about how environment variables work in Control Plane, please see the environment variables section of the [workload reference](/reference/workload#environment-variables) page.

## Sticky Sessions

Add the following [tags](/reference/misc#tags) and desired values to a GVC to enable sticky sessions for **ALL** [Workloads](/concepts/workload) within the GVC:

1. `cpln/sessionCookie`
   - The name of the session cookie.
2. `cpln/sessionDuration`
   - The Golang duration for the maximum session length (e.g., 300s, 30m, etc.).
   - Review this [link](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) for the proper Golang duration string format.

Once these tags are set, soft session affinity based on a cookie will consistently route requests to the same replica. The affinity to a particular replica will be lost if the replica restarts.

### How to add Tags using the UI

1. Browse to the [Console UI](https://console.cpln.io/) and select the desired GVC.
2. Click the `Tags` link in the middle context menu.
3. Click `Edit Tags`.
4. Enter the string `cpln/sessionCookie` in the `Tag Key` text box and enter the desired cookie name in the `Tag Value` text box. Click `Add Tag`.
5. Enter the string `cpln/sessionDuration` in the `Tag Key` text box and enter the desired duration in the `Tag Value` text box. Click `Add Tag`.
6. Click `Save`.

### How to add Tags using the CLI

Execute the following CLI command (substitute the GVC_NAME, ORG_NAME, COOKIE_NAME, DURATION tokens) to add the requires Tags to a GVC:

```bash
cpln gvc tag GVC_NAME --tag cpln/sessionCookie=COOKIE_NAME --tag cpln/sessionDuration=DURATION --org ORG_NAME
```

## Export GVC

Using the console UI, when a GVC is selected, an `Export GVC` link is available which will save (as a local multi-document YAML manifest file) the GVC and all associated resources ([Identities](/reference/identity), [Volume Sets](/reference/volumeset) and [Workloads](/concepts/workload)).

Links to other resources are relative within the exported file. This allows the file to be easily used to backup and restore an entire GVC. It can also be used when promoting to other [Orgs](/reference/org).

The export doesn't contain any referenced [Orgs](/reference/org) resources, such as, [Secrets](/reference/secret), [Cloud Accounts](/reference/cloudaccount), and [Agents](/reference/agent). These resources would need to be exported separately.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission | Description          | Implies                            |
| :--------- | :------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| create     | Create new gvcs      |                                    |
| delete     | Delete existing gvcs |                                    |
| edit       | Modify existing gvcs | view                               |
| manage     | Full access          | create, delete, edit, manage, view |
| view       | Read-only access     |                                    |
