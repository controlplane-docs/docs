## Upgrading Provider Version

After installing a new provider version, follow these steps to upgrade an existing installation:

1. Update the version property inside the HCL file that contains the `required_providers` declaration block for the `cpln` provider.

2. Run the command: `terraform init -upgrade` to upgrade the Terraform dependencies (state file, etc.). The Terraform commands (plan, apply, etc.) will now use the latest version.

<Note>

If necessary, the provider version can be downgraded.
