title: BYOK Volume Set settings
---

When using a volume set in a BYOK environment, there are some additional configuration settings available

## Storage Class Suffix

You can specify a `spec.storageClassSuffix` in a volume set. When this property is set, Control Plane will look for a storage class including this suffix. Storage classes are constructed by combining `spec.performanceClass`, `spec.fileSystemType`, and (optionally) the `spec.storageClassSuffix`. If a storage class including the suffix cannot be found, Control Plane falls back to the storage class excluding the suffix. This allows BYOK users to utilize any CSI-compatible storage solution they wish.
