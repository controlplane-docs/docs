title: Actuator Settings
---

The Actuator component receives events from Control Plane and uses the metadata provided in the events to instantiate
the desired configuration on the kubernetes cluster. This can be Kubernetes deployments, domain routing configuration, storage devices, etc.

## Settings

These environment variables can be provided to the actuator deployment on the cluster. If you are making adjustments to these settings
provide the changes to Control Plane support so they will be included when new manifests are generated.

#### INGRESS_REQ_CPU 

- The initial cpu request size used for shared and dedicated load balancer ingress deployments.

#### INGRESS_REQ_MEM

- The initial memory request size used for shared and dedicated load balancer ingress deployments.

#### INGRESS_TARGET_CPU_PERCENT 

- The target cpu percent used by the horizontal pod autoscalers for shared and dedicated load balancer ingress deployments.
  This should be calculated with awareness that the cpu value used is 4000 millicores but may be less if small nodes are used.
  For example, if the request size is set to 1000m and desire a target to be 3000m, then set this value to 300.

#### INGRESS_FIREWALL_CIDR_LIST

- A comma delimited list of CIDRs used to restrict inbound access for shared and dedicated load balancers.

#### INGRESS_LOAD_BALANCER_SCHEME 
- One of `internet-facing` or `internal`. When internal is used then you must be on a private network to access the workloads
  running in this location. Automated detection of geo-routing is limited in this configuration since the external monitoring
  will not be able to reach the endpoints.

#### INGRESS_ANNOTATIONS 

- Annotations to be used instead of standard generated ones for the load balancer service for shared and dedicated load balancer
  ingress deployments. This can be useful if your cloud provider load balancer controller is not already supported by Control Plane
  and requires a specific annotation.

#### INGRESS_EXTRA_ANNOTATIONS 

- Extra annotations to be added to the load balancer service for shared and dedicated load balancers. This is useful if a specific
  annotation should be used in your environment for all load balancers. This is applied after the standard load balancer annotations
  and can be used to replace existing values. Passthrough annotations are applied after this can be used to make additional
  adjustments to specific dedicated load balancers.

#### INGRESS_PORTS

- An array of ports used to limit the custom ports that are added to dedicated load balancers.
