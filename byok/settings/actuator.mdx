title: Actuator Settings
---

The Actuator component receives events from Control Plane and uses the metadata provided in the events to instantiate the desired configuration on the kubernetes cluster. This can be Kubernetes deployments, domain routing configuration, storage devices, etc.

## Settings

These environment variables can be added into configuration for the actuator to adjust the behavior of the CPLN Platform.

To adjustment these settings, make changes to the [CPLN Platform Add-on](/mk8s/add-ons/byok) configuration or manually adjust the cpln-byok-current configmap if you are running your own Kubernetes.

### INGRESS_REQ_CPU

- The initial cpu request size used for shared and dedicated load balancer ingress deployments.

### INGRESS_REQ_MEM

- The initial memory request size used for shared and dedicated load balancer ingress deployments.

### INGRESS_TARGET_CPU_PERCENT

- The target cpu percent used by the horizontal pod autoscalers for shared and dedicated load balancer ingress deployments. This should be calculated with awareness that the cpu value used is 4000 millicores but may be less if small nodes are used. For example, if the request size is set to 1000m and you desire a target to be 3000m, then set this value to 300.

### INGRESS_FIREWALL_CIDR_LIST

- A comma delimited list of CIDRs used to restrict inbound access for shared and dedicated load balancers.

### INGRESS_LOAD_BALANCER_SCHEME

- One of `internet-facing` or `internal`. When internal is used then you must be on a private network to access the workloads running in this location. Automated detection of geo-routing is limited in this configuration since the external monitoring will not be able to reach the endpoints.

### INGRESS_ANNOTATIONS

- Annotations to be used instead of standard generated ones for the load balancer service for shared and dedicated load balancer ingress deployments. This can be useful if your cloud provider load balancer controller is not already supported by Control Plane and requires a specific annotation.

### INGRESS_EXTRA_ANNOTATIONS

- Extra annotations to be added to the load balancer service for shared and dedicated load balancers. This is useful if a specific annotation should be used in your environment for all load balancers. This is applied after the standard load balancer annotations and can be used to replace existing values. Pass through annotations are applied after this can be used to make additional adjustments to specific dedicated load balancers.

### INGRESS_PORTS

- An array of ports used to limit the custom ports that are added to dedicated load balancers.

### BYOK_K8S_API_WORKLOADS

- An array of workload links which are allowed to access the kubernetes api.
- The ClusterRole the workloads are given should be specified with the tag cpln/k8sClusterRole on the workload.
<Note>
Ensure the ClusterRole already exists
</Note>

### THIN_PROVISION

- Percent of CPU that is guaranteed for workloads.

#### How to Configure Thin Provisioning

To configure thin provisioning, you need to modify the cpln-byok-current ConfigMap in the kube-system namespace. This ConfigMap contains the actuator settings where you can specify the THIN_PROVISION environment variable.

#### Steps to Configure

1. Modify the cpln-byok-current configmap in the kube-system namespace.

1. In the actuator settings, add an environment variable named THIN_PROVISION.

This variable should have a value representing the percentage of resources that will be guaranteed. For example, if you want to reserve 800m when 1000m is requested, set THIN_PROVISION to .8.

Example Configuration:
Here is an example of how the configuration should look:

```json

   {
     "actuator": {
       "env": {
         "CACHE_PERIOD_DATA_SERVICE": "600",
         "LABEL_NODES": "false",
         "THIN_PROVISION": ".8"
       }
     }
   }

```
