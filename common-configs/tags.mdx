title: Tags

Tags are key-value pairs that can be assigned to items. All Control Plane resources support tags except for `quota` items.

These tags can be used by the clients to query/filter/select a resource based on its keys and value.

Also some kinds support targeting items of other kinds, by utilizing tags through a [query](/platform/query).

## CPLN Assigned Tags

Control Plane Platform can assign tags to items. See the list below for each item kind that is assigned a tag automatically,

### Location Items

`cpln/city`, `cpln/continent`, `cpln/country`

### User Items

`firebase/sign_in_provider`

## Invalid Tag Keys

Any tag key starting with `cpln/` is reserved and cannot be altered by the user.

<Note>

The value of tag `cpln/deployTimestamp` can be overridden by the users, when done so, it will force a redeployment of the workload.

</Note>

## Tag Links

If a tag's value starts with one of `http://, https://, ws://, wss://`, the Console UI will show it as a link on the info page of all items.
