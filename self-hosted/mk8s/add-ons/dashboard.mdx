title: Kubernetes Dashboard
---

## Overview

The Kubernetes Dashboard add-on provides a user-friendly interface, enabling users to manage and monitor their Kubernetes clusters directly from a web interface. This add-on simplifies cluster management tasks and offers a comprehensive view of the cluster's state.

For more details, please refer to the official Kubernetes documentation [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/).

## How to Enable

The Dashboard add-on can be enabled for your Kubernetes cluster either during the cluster creation process or at any time thereafter. The following sections outline the methods for enabling the add-on:

### At Cluster Creation

- **Through Cluster Manifest**: Add the following snippet to your cluster manifest when creating the cluster:

  ```yaml YAML
  spec:
    ...
    addOns:
      dashboard: {}
    ...
  ```

- **Using the Console**: If you're creating the cluster through the console, navigate to `Add-ons`, find the `Dashboard` add-on in the list of available add-ons, and toggle it on.

### After Cluster Creation

If the Dashboard add-on was not enabled during the cluster creation, you can still enable it using either of the following methods:

#### Using Manifest

Under `spec.addOns` in the YAML manifest of the cluster, you can edit it either by navigating to the cluster in the Console and using the `Edit & Apply` option for the cluster, or by applying the entire manifest using the `cpln apply >_` option in the upper right corner or by using the `cpln` [CLI](/(/reference/cli).

Add the following:

```yaml YAML
spec:
---
addOns:
  dashboard: {}
```

#### Using UI

1. **Navigate to Control Plane Console**: Visit the [Control Plane Console](https://console.cpln.io/console/).
2. **Navigate to the Kubernetes cluster**: In the Control Plane Console, navigate to `Kubernetes` in the left sidebar panel and click on the Kubernetes cluster for which you want to enable the dashboard.
3. **Enable the Dashboard**: Choose `Add-ons` and locate the `Dashboard` add-on from the list of available add-ons, then toggle it on.

## How to Access

Once enabled, the Dashboard add-on can be used as follows:

1. **Navigate to Control Plane Console**: Visit the [Control Plane Console](https://console.cpln.io/console/).
2. **Access the Dashboard**: In the Control Plane Console, navigate to `Kubernetes` in the left sidebar panel and click on `Open` under `Dashboard` for the cluster.
