title: Generic Provider
---

The Generic provider for Managed Kubernetes allows Linux-based servers to be converted into worker nodes of a Kubernetes cluster, irrespective of their deployment in public clouds (such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Hetzner, etc.) or in private cloud / on-premises environments. Once integrated, these servers join a Kubernetes cluster as worker nodes, enabling the deployment of Kubernetes workloads through the Kubernetes API.

## Supported Add-Ons

- [Dashboard:](/mk8s/add-ons/dashboard) Provides a Kubernetes dashboard UI for the cluster.
- [AWS Workload Identity:](/mk8s/add-ons/aws_workload_identity) Allows your pods to assume AWS IAM Roles.
- [AWS ECR:](/mk8s/add-ons/aws_ecr) Allows pulling images from private ECR registries.
- [Local Path Storage:](/mk8s/add-ons/local_path_storage) Create PVCs backed by local volumes.
- [Logs:](/mk8s/add-ons/logs) Enable logging for pods and cluster auditing.

## Step 1 - Servers Setup

1. **Ensure Availability of Server(s)**: Create at least one server that matches the `server requirements`:
   - Server(s) requirements:
     - Linux Kernel version 5.x.x or higher
     - Minimum CPU: 1 Core
     - Minimum RAM: 512 MB
   - Servers require Internet egress access
   - Ensure you have SSH access to the servers

## Step 2 - Creating Managed Kubernetes Cluster with Manifest

1. **Update the manifest below**: (Optional) Modify the following `generic-mk8s-template.yaml` YAML manifest if needed.

```yaml YAML
kind: mk8s
name: generic-mk8s-example
description: generic-mk8s-example mk8s in gcp-us-east1
tags: {}
spec:
  provider:
    generic:
      location: gcp-us-east1
      nodePools:
        - name: general
          labels:
            environment: generic-mk8s-example
          taints: []
  addOns:
    dashboard: {}
    localPathStorage: {}
    awsWorkloadIdentity: {}
  firewall:
    - description: default
      sourceCIDR: 0.0.0.0/0
  version: 1.28.2
```

This example creates a Generic cluster with the following configurations:

- **[Add-ons](#supported-add-ons)**: Includes Dashboard, Local Path Storage, and AWS Workload Identity.
- **Location**: The cluster's Kubernetes control plane will be managed in the `gcp-us-east1` location. Placing worker nodes close to the control plane is recommended for optimal performance.
- **Kubernetes API Firewall**: Utilizes the `Default` rule, allowing public access to the Kubernetes API. It is advisable to restrict API access to a known IP range for security purposes.
- **Kubernetes Version**: 1.28.2.
- **Node Pool**: A single `general` node pool.

2. **Create the Cluster**: Deploy the `generic-mk8s-example` cluster by applying the manifest.

   - **CLI**: Execute `cpln apply -f generic-mk8s-template.yaml --org YOUR_ORG_HERE`.
   - **Console**: Apply the `generic-mk8s-template.yaml` file using the `cpln apply >_` option in the upper right corner.

   **Wait until the cluster is initialized.**

## Step 3 - Connecting the Server(s) to the Cluster

1. **Obtain the Join Script**:

   - **Using the CLI**:
     a. **Save the Join Script to a file**: Execute the command `cpln mk8s join generic-mk8s-example --type join-script --options nodePoolName=general > join_general.sh`

   - **Using the UI**:
     a. **Navigate to the Control Plane Console**: Visit the [Control Plane Console](https://console.cpln.io/console/).
     b. **Access the Dashboard**: In the Control Plane Console, navigate to `Kubernetes` in the left sidebar panel, click on the `generic-mk8s-example` cluster, and go to `Node Pools`. Click on `More` on the right side of the `general` Node Pool and select `Generate Join Script`.

2. **Copy and Execute the Script on the Server**: Connect to the remote server and execute the Join Script. After the execution, the server should be joined to the cluster as a node under the `general` node pool. Repeat these steps for all necessary servers.

## Step 4 - Accessing the Cluster

### 1. Using the Terminal

1. **Obtain the Cluster's Kubeconfig File**: Execute the command `cpln mk8s kubeconfig generic-mk8s-example -f /tmp/generic-mk8s-example-conf`.
2. **Access the Cluster with `kubectl`**: Use the obtained kubeconfig file by running `export KUBECONFIG=/tmp/generic-mk8s-example-conf` for the current shell session.

### 2. Using Kubernetes Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Control Plane Console**: Visit the [Control Plane Console](https://console.cpln.io/console/).
2. **Access the Dashboard**: In the Control Plane Console, navigate to `Kubernetes` in the left sidebar panel and click on `Open` under `Dashboard` for the cluster `generic-mk8s-example`.
