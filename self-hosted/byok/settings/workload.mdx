title: Workload Settings
---

When running workloads on a BYOK Location, there are some additional configuration settings that are available.

## Internal Firewall Settings

When a workload is running on the Control Plane cloud platform IP Addresses and CIDR blocks configured for the external firewall of a workload are ignored if they are in any private address ranges. When running in a BYOK location these internal address ranges are allowed and can be used to directly access internal resources in your data center.

## Custom Tags

An extra list of Control Plane tags can be used to change the behavior of workloads when they are run in BYOK Locations.

### Disable Service Mesh

`cpln/disableServiceMesh`=`true`

- When this tag is added to a workload the inbound and outbound sidecar is completely disabled. this can be useful in situations where proxying can confuse clients that are expecting direct IP communication without any NAT.

### Disable Service Mesh Inbound Port

`cpln/disableServiceMeshInboundPort`

- A comma delimited list of ports to exclude from being intercepted by the sidecar proxy inbound.

### Disable Service Mesh Outbound Port

`cpln/disableServiceMeshOutboundPort`

- A comma delimited list of ports to exclude from being intercepted by the sidecar proxy outbound.

### Disable Service Mesh Outbound CIDR

`cpln/disableServiceMeshOutboundPort`

- A comma delimited list of CIDR IP ranges to exclude from being intercepted by the sidecar proxy outbound.

### ClusterRole

`cpln/k8sClusterRole`

- The ClusterRole that should be binded to the workload
  <Note>The actuator must be configured to allow this. See [BYOK Actuator settings](/byok/settings/actuator#byok-k8s-api-workloads)</Note>
