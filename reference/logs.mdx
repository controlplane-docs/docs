## Overview

The logs UI displays the logs for your running [workloads](workload). No matter which combination of cloud providers or regions your workload is running at, the logs will be aggregated and displayed as if they were running at one provider/region.

[Filters](#log-filters) can be applied to pinpoint any issues that might be occurring at a specific [workload](workload).

The [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) explorer is available to query and visualize your log data.

## Sample Log UI

Below is a sample of the Log UI after executing a query:

## LogQL

The Control Plane logs use the LogQL query language to query your log data.

The documentation for LogQL is available [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/).

The available labels that can be used to create a query are:

- container
- gvc
- location
- replica
- stream
- workload

## Log Filters

The results of a query can be filtered by the following:

- [Location](location)
- [Container](workload#containers)
- Start date and optional end date
  - The date/time selector includes helper buttons ranging from the `Last 5 minutes` to the `Last 30 days`

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

Selecting a [location](location) or [container](workload#containers) will automatically add the value to the LogQL query.

## Live Logs

The results of the given query can be streamed in real-time using the `Live` button.

After entering the desired query, click the `Live` button`.

To end the live streaming, click the `Stop` button.

## Grafana

Clicking on the `Explore on Grafana` link will launch the Grafana UI in a new tab. When clicking the button from a specific [workload](workload), the query will be prefilled with the [GVC](gvc) and [workload](workload).

Grafana gives you the ability to "Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drill-down. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries, and data sources side by side."

View the documentation for Grafana [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/).

## Example LogQL Queries

- View the logs for a specific [GVC](gvc) and [workload](workload)

```log Query
{gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME"}
```

- View the logs for a GVC, workload, location, and container

```log Query
{gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME", location="aws-eu-central-1", container="CONTAINER_NAME"}
```

## Log Retention Policy

The log retention period for logs stored at Control Plane is 30 days by default and can be adjusted for each Org.
