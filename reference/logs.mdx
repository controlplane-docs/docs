## Overview

The logs UI displays the logs for your running [workloads](/concepts/workload). No matter which combination of cloud providers or regions your workload is running at, the logs will be aggregated and displayed as if they were running at one provider/region.

[Filters](#log-filters) can be applied to pinpoint any issues that might be occurring at a specific [workload](/concepts/workload).

The [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) explorer is available to query and visualize your log data.

## Sample Log UI

Below is a sample of the Log UI after executing a query:

## LogQL

The Control Plane logs use the LogQL query language to query your log data.

The documentation for LogQL is available [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/).

The available labels that can be used to create a query are:

- container
- gvc
- location
- replica
- stream
- workload

## Log Filters

The results of a query can be filtered by the following:

- [Location](/reference/location)
- [Container](/reference/workload/containers)
- Start date and optional end date

  - The date/time selector includes helper buttons ranging from the `Last 5 minutes` to the `Last 30 days`

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/reference/logs/log-ui-date-selector.png" />
    </Frame>

Selecting a [location](/reference/location) or [container](/reference/workload/containers) will automatically add the value to the LogQL query.

## Live Logs

The results of the given query can be streamed in real-time using the `Live` button.

After entering the desired query, click the `Live` button.

To end the live streaming, click the `Stop` button.

## Grafana

Clicking on the `Explore on Grafana` link will launch the Grafana UI in a new tab. When clicking the button from a specific [workload](/concepts/workload), the query will be prefilled with the [GVC](/reference/gvc) and [workload](/concepts/workload).

Grafana gives you the ability to "Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drill-down. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries, and data sources side by side."

View the documentation for Grafana [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/).

## Example LogQL Queries

- View the logs for a specific [GVC](/reference/gvc) and [workload](/concepts/workload)

```log Query
{gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME"}
```

- Access logs with error

```log Query
{gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME", container="_accesslog"}  |= "\" 50"
```

- Graph of access logs with error by replica

```log Query
sum(count_over_time({gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME", container="_accesslog"}  |= "\" 50"[1m])) by (replica)
```

- Graph of access logs with error by workload

```log Query
sum(count_over_time({gvc="GVC_NAME", container="_accesslog"}  |= "\" 50"[1m])) by (workload)
```

- View the logs for a GVC, workload, location, and container

```log Query
{gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME", location="aws-eu-central-1", container="CONTAINER_NAME"}
```

- View all logs (will contain all workloads logs across all gvcs)

```log Query
{gvc=~".+"}
```

- Count of inbound requests by ip

This query will produce a count of inbound requests by source ip address for the last 10 minutes.
You must set the grafana query options to type `Instant` so that a list is produced and can be sorted.

```log Query
sum(count_over_time({gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME", container="_accesslog"} | logfmt | regexp "(?P<ip>\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)"[10m])) by (ip)
```

- Count of inbound requests by path

This query will produce a count of inbound requests by request path for the last 10 minutes with a latency greater than 100ms.
You must set the grafana query options to type `Instant` so that a list is produced and can be sorted.


```log Query
sum(count_over_time({gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME", container="_accesslog"} | logfmt | regexp "(?P<path>\\/[^\"]*\\s).+\\d+ \\d+ \\d+ (?P<latency>\\d+) " | latency > 100 [10m])) by (workload, path)
```


## Log Retention Policy

The log retention period for logs stored at Control Plane is 30 days by default and can be adjusted for each Org.
