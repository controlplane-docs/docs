title: Overview
---

The Reference section provides detailed documentation for all Control Plane resources. Each resource type has specific properties, permissions, and relationships that enable you to build secure, scalable applications across multiple cloud providers.

---

## Resource Hierarchy

Control Plane uses a hierarchical structure where resources are scoped to provide isolation and governance:

```
Org (Organization)
├── Principals: Users, Groups, Service Accounts
├── Governance: Policies, Quotas
├── Infrastructure: Cloud Accounts, Agents, Locations
├── Assets: Secrets, Images, Domains
└── GVC (Global Virtual Cloud)
    ├── Workloads
    ├── Identities
    └── Volume Sets
```

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission Model">
    Control Plane uses a role-based access control model where **Policies** grant specific permissions to **Principals** (users, groups, service accounts, identities) for target resources. Permissions follow hierarchical "implies" relationships - for example, `manage` implies `create`, `delete`, and `edit`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Cloud Deployment">
    A single **GVC** can deploy workloads across multiple **Locations** spanning AWS, GCP, and Azure regions simultaneously. Traffic is automatically routed to the nearest healthy instance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Workload Identity">
    **Identities** provide credential-free access to cloud resources and private networks. Instead of embedding secrets in your code, workloads assume cloud-native identities (AWS IAM roles, GCP service accounts, Azure managed identities) at runtime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Private Network Access">
    **Agents** create secure tunnels to private networks without exposing them to the internet. Combined with **Identities**, workloads can access databases, APIs, and services in your VPCs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
