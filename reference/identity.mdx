## Overview

**Identity** (also known as a workload identity) is one of the four Control Plane [principal types](/concepts/principal_types) (users, service accounts, groups, and identities).

A [workload](/concepts/workload) needing to consume cloud resources from one or more cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, and GCP) without storing credentials or needing to communicate to endpoints within a private network - must be assigned an **identity**.

An **identity** is a named object that allows an authorized administrator to define:

### [Cloud Provider Access (Universal Cloud Identity)](/reference/identity#cloud-provider-access)

- Least-privilege access rules allowed on cloud resources across cloud providers. Each identity can reference only one cloud account per provider. For example, you can have one account in Azure and one account in GCP, but not two different accounts in GCP within the same identity. You define access policies granted to the identity for each cloud provider you need to use (one, two, or all three clouds, depending on your workload requirements).

### [Private Network Access (Cloud Wormhole)](/reference/identity#network-resources-networkresources)

- Network traversal rules from [workloads](/concepts/workload) into specific endpoints in private networks (e.g., a VPC). These rules connect an [agent](/reference/agent) in a private network to the Control Plane infrastructure, allowing [workloads](/concepts/workload) to selectively access TCP endpoints inside private networks where [agents](/reference/agent) are installed and running.

### [Native Cloud Network Access](/reference/identity#native-network-resources-nativenetworkresources)

- Provides secure, private connectivity from a [workload](/concepts/workload) to cloud-hosted services across AWS (vpc endpoints) and GCP (private service connect) without traversing the public internet. It leverages cloud provider-specific private networking services to route traffic over internal infrastructure. This enables low-latency, secure communication to private resources while maintaining strict network isolation and identity-based access control.

An **identity** is scoped to a [GVC](/reference/gvc) and can be assigned to multiple [workloads](/concepts/workload) within the same [GVC](/reference/gvc) that needs the same cloud resources and network access.

A [workload](/concepts/workload) can be assigned exactly one **identity**. An **identity** is only required when a [workload](/concepts/workload) needs to consume cloud resources without embedding credentials and/or when a [workload](/concepts/workload) needs to consume resources in a private network such as a VPC. If neither is required, a [workload](/concepts/workload) can operate **without** assigning it an **identity**.

Once configured, an **identity** assigned to a [workload](/concepts/workload) enables it to:

- Access specific resources of AWS, Azure, and/or GCP
- Access private network resources from external cloud accounts, data centers or any other private network. (Tunneling network traffic from [workloads](/concepts/workload) to specific TCP hosts and ports is facilitated using [agents](/reference/agent). This capability is referred to as “wormholes”.)
- Access the NATS NGS service using scoped credentials automatically supplied at runtime

<Warning>

Identities are powerful Control Plane resources that can be granted any permission to your cloud environment. The ability to create identities should only be given to administrators by using a [policy](/reference/policy).

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission | Description                                                | Implies                                 |
