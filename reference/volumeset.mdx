title: Volume Set
---

## Overview
A volume set is a collection of storage volumes, which may be linked to one or more workloads running on Control Plane. The behavior varies greatly depending on your choice of filesystem.

### Traditional File Systems (ext4, xfs)
- Control Plane provisions a unique volume for each replica in the linked workload.
- Each volume set can be used by at most one [stateful workload](/reference/workload/types#stateful).
- Each volume in the set is bound to a single workload replica
- Data is not replicated between volumes. If you require data sharing or replication, this must be accomplished at the application level (e.g. by using WAL streaming between two Postgresql instances)

### Shared File System
- Control Plane provisions a single volume per location
- The volume set can be attached to any number of workloads
- All attached workload replicas in a given location use the same volume

#### Caveats
The shared filesystem does not support:
- snapshots
- certain commands:
  - `createVolumeSnapshot`
  - `deleteVolumeSnapshot`
  - `restoreVolume`
  - `deleteVolume`

### Capacity and Billing

- When a volume is created, it will have an initial capacity defined by the spec of your volume set.
- Volume capacity can be increased by sending an `expandVolume` command.
- Volume capacity cannot be decreased.
- The bill for a volume set is calculated by summing the reserved GB of all volumes.

## Autoscaling

### One Volume Per Replica
<Note>The only applies to volume sets using traditional file systems (e.g. ext4, xfs)</Note>
- Like workloads, volume sets scale horizontally. Every replica in the linked workload is automatically assigned a volume.
- When the linked workload scales down, the volumes are preserved. Volumes are only deleted when you send a `deleteVolume` command, or when the volume set itself is deleted.

### Automatic Expansion

The `spec.autoscaling` object allows you to specify rules for automatically expanding volumes in the set. The available options are:

- `maxCapacity`: The largest allowable size for any volume in the set.
- `minFreePercentage`: This must be a number between 1 and 100. When the free percentage on any volume drops below this threshold, Control Plane will issue an `expandVolume` command automatically.
- `scalingFactor`: This must be a number {`>`} 1. When a volume must be expanded, the new capacity will be (the minimum size to ensure `minFreePercentage`) {`*`} `scalingFactor`. E.g. if a volume is using 8/10 GB, and the `minFreePercentage` is 50, the new capacity will be 16 {`*`} `scalingFactor`, assuming that product is {`<=`} `maxCapacity`.

For example:

```json Volume Set Autoscaling
{
  ...
  "spec": {
    ...
    "autoscaling": {
       "maxCapacity": 100,
       "minFreePercentage": 70,
       "scalingFactor": 2
    }
  }
}
```

## Snapshots

Snapshots can be taken at any time and (optionally) on a regular schedule. To set up automatic snapshotting, you may use the `spec.snapshots` object. Options include:

- `retentionDuration`: The length of time to retain a newly created snapshot. This should be a floating point number followed by either d, h, or m (for day, hour or minute)
- `schedule`: A cron expression describing the snapshot frequency. Snapshots cannot be taken more frequently than once per hour.

## File System Type
Currently supported file systems are:

- ext4
- xfs
- shared

## Mount Resources
For the shared file system only, you will be charged CPU and memory per mount point. Shared volumes must be
mounted once per node.
<Note>There will be __at most__ one mount point per replica.</Note>

You can control the minimum and maximum resource allocations per mount point using the `mountOptions` property. e.g.

``` json
{
  "kind": "volumeset",
  "name": "my-shared-volumeset",
  "description": "",
  "tags": {},
  "spec": {
    "fileSystemType": "shared",
    "initialCapacity": 10,
    "mountOptions": {
      "resources": {
        "maxCpu": "200m",
        "maxMemory": "128Mi",
        "minCpu": "100m",
        "minMemory": "128Mi"
      }
    },
    "performanceClass": "shared"
  }
}
```

### Resource Constraints

- `minCpu` and `maxCpu` can be at most 4000m apart
- The ratio between `minCpu` and `maxCpu` must be at least 1:4
- `minMemory` and `maxMemory` can be at most 4096Mi apart
- The ratio between `minMemory` and `maxMemory` must be at least 1:4

## Performance Classes

Each volume set has a single, immutable, performance class.

The performance class determines:

- How many Megabytes per second can be transferred to and from the volume (MB/second)
- How many I/O operations can be processed per second. (IOPS)
- Read/write latency

<Note>Because these drives are served over the network, IOPS/throughput is limited per VM. The performance of individual drives will vary.</Note>

Volume performance varies widely by cloud service provider.

## Custom Encryption (AWS)

Control Plane encrypts all volumes by default. The custom encryption feature allows you to specify your own AWS KMS keys for encrypting volumes in a volume set, giving you complete control over the encryption keys used for your data.

### When to Use Custom Encryption

Use custom encryption when you need to:
- Meet specific compliance or regulatory requirements that mandate customer-managed keys
- Maintain control over key lifecycle management (rotation, revocation, etc.)
- Use separate encryption keys for different environments or applications
- Integrate with existing key management workflows

<Note>Custom encryption is currently only available for AWS. Support for other cloud providers is not yet available.</Note>

### Prerequisites

Before configuring custom encryption, you need:

1. **An AWS KMS key** in each region where you want to use custom encryption
2. **Appropriate KMS key policies** configured for the KMS key to allow volume encryption

#### Required Key Policies

Your KMS key policy must permit to Control Plane to use the key for volume encryption. The policies below grant the necessary permissions. You must add these policies to any KMS key used with Control Plan volume sets.

```json
[
  {
    "Sid": "GrantAccessToControlPlane",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": [
        "arn:aws:iam::957753459089:root"
      ]
    },
    "Action": [
      "kms:Decrypt",
      "kms:DescribeKey",
      "kms:Encrypt",
      "kms:GenerateDataKey",
      "kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext",
      "kms:ReEncrypt*",
      "kms:CreateGrant",
      "kms:RetireGrant",
      "kms:RevokeGrant"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
  },
  {
    "Sid": "GrantAccessToControlPlaneEC2",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": [
      "kms:CreateGrant",
      "kms:Decrypt",
      "kms:DescribeKey",
      "kms:GenerateDataKey"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "kms:ViaService": "ec2.{REGION}.amazonaws.com",
        "kms:CallerAccount": "957753459089"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Configuration Schema

Custom encryption is configured in the volume set `spec` using the `customEncryption` object:

```json
{
  "spec": {
    "customEncryption": {
      "regions": {
        "{cloud-provider}-{region}": {
          "keyId": "arn:aws:kms:region:account:key/key-id"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**

- `customEncryption.regions`: An object mapping region names to encryption configurations
- `{cloud-provider}-{region}`: The region identifier in Control Plane format (e.g., `aws-us-east-1`, `aws-eu-west-1`)
- `keyId`: The full ARN of the AWS KMS key to use for volumes in that region

### Region Naming Format

Region names must follow the format: `aws-{aws-region-name}`

Examples:
- `aws-us-east-1` for US East (N. Virginia)
- `aws-us-west-2` for US West (Oregon)
- `aws-eu-west-1` for EU (Ireland)
- `aws-ap-southeast-1` for Asia Pacific (Singapore)

### Complete Example

Here's a full example of a volume set with custom encryption configured for two AWS regions:

```json Volume Set with Custom Encryption
{
  "kind": "volumeset",
  "name": "my-encrypted-volumeset",
  "description": "Production database volumes with custom encryption",
  "tags": {
    "app": "database",
    "env": "production"
  },
  "spec": {
    "fileSystemType": "ext4",
    "initialCapacity": 100,
    "performanceClass": "high-throughput-ssd",
    "autoscaling": {
      "maxCapacity": 500,
      "minFreePercentage": 20,
      "scalingFactor": 1.5
    },
    "snapshots": {
      "retentionDuration": "7d",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    },
    "customEncryption": {
      "regions": {
        "aws-us-east-1": {
          "keyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
        },
        "aws-eu-west-1": {
          "keyId": "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-1:123456789012:key/abcdefab-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdefabcdef"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Important Constraints

<Warning>
Be aware of the following constraints when using custom encryption:
</Warning>

**Key Immutability**
- Once a volume is created with a specific KMS key, the encryption key cannot be changed
- To use a different key, you must create new volumes

**Regional Configuration**
- Encryption keys are configured per region, not globally
- Each region can have its own KMS key
- If a region is not specified in `customEncryption.regions`, volumes in that region will use AWS default encryption

**File System Support**
- Custom encryption only works with traditional file systems: `ext4` and `xfs`
- The `shared` file system does not support custom encryption

**BYOK Clusters**
- This feature is for Control Plane-managed clusters only
- For BYOK clusters you have full control over your storage classes, and therefore the encryption method as well.

## Commands

Volume sets support imperative operations on individual volumes and snapshots. To issue a command, send a `POST` to the volume set's `-command` endpoint. e.g. `POST https://api.cpln.io/org/my-org/gvc/my-gvc/volumeset/my-volume-set/-command`. These commands can also be created using the Control Plane console at https://console.cpln.io

## Volume Expansion

Volumes can be expanded on-demand by issuing an `expandVolume` command. If the volume set is in-use by a workload, the corresponding workload replica will be restarted.

<Warning>You can only expand a volume once every six hours. Please plan accordingly.</Warning>

<Info>Volumes cannot be "expanded" to a smaller size.</Info>

### expandVolume

Spec:

- location
- volumeIndex
- newStorageCapacity

For example:

```json expandVolume Command
{
  "type": "expandVolume",
  "spec": {
    "location": "aws-sa-east-1",
    "volumeIndex": 0,
    "newStorageCapacity": 11
  }
}
```

## Volume Deletion

To delete a volume, issue a `deleteVolume` command.

### deleteVolume

This command deletes the specified volume's storage device. Note: the metadata for the volume at the specified index will not be removed from the volume set. Only your data will be deleted.

### Deleting an in-use volume

If the volume set is in-use by a workload, a new storage device may be immediately created. e.g. if the volume set is in-use by a workload with one replica, and you delete the volume at index 0, Control Plane will:

1. Create an empty volume to service the workload
2. Delete the old volume as requested
3. Restart the workload replica, binding it to the volume created in step 1.

For example:

```json deleteVolume Command
{
  "type": "deleteVolume",
  "spec": {
    "location": "aws-sa-east-1",
    "volumeIndex": 0
  }
}
```

## Snapshots

Each volume in a set has its own list of snapshots. You manipulate snapshots by issuing commands to the volume set.

### createVolumeSnapshot

Take a snapshot for a given volume (specified by location and volume index). `snapshotName` must be unique for the target volume.

Spec:

- location
- volumeIndex
- snapshotName
- snapshotExpirationDate
- tags
  - Specify any key/value pair here.

For example:

```json createVolumeSnapshot Command
{
  "type": "createVolumeSnapshot",
  "spec": {
    "location": "aws-sa-east-1",
    "volumeIndex": 0,
    "snapshotName": "snap-0",
    "snapshotExpirationDate": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "tags": {
      "my-tag-key": "my-tag-value"
    }
  }
}
```

### deleteVolumeSnapshot

Delete the specified snapshot.

Spec:

- location
- volumeIndex
- snapshotName

For example:

```json deleteVolumeSnapshot Command
{
  "type": "deleteVolumeSnapshot",
  "spec": {
    "location": "aws-sa-east-1",
    "volumeIndex": 0,
    "snapshotName": "snap-0"
  }
}
```

### restoreVolume

Restore the specified volume to one of its snapshots. If this volume set is in-use by a workload, the corresponding workload replica will restart.

<Warning>

This operation creates an entirely new volume using the given snapshot. All unsaved data on the original volume will be lost.

</Warning>

Spec:

- location
- volumeIndex
- snapshotName

For example:

```json restoreVolume Command
{
  "type": "restoreVolume",
  "spec": {
    "location": "aws-sa-east-1",
    "volumeIndex": 0,
    "snapshotName": "snap-0"
  }
}
```

## BYOK Support

Volume sets are supported in BYOK locations as long as the following prerequisites are met:

1. The cluster must have a CSI-compatible storage driver installed.

2. You must create storage classes which use the CSI-compatible provisioner, with the following names:
   - `general-purpose-ssd-ext4`
   - `general-purpose-ssd-xfs`
   - `premium-low-latency-ssd-ext4`
   - `premium-low-latency-ssd-xfs`
   - `general-purpose-ssd-ext4-command`
   - `general-purpose-ssd-xfs-command`
   - `premium-low-latency-ssd-ext4-command`
   - `premium-low-latency-ssd-xfs-command`

## Planned Features

- Automatic volume expansion.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four [principal types](/concepts/access-control):

| Permission                | Description                               | Implies                                                                                                                                                  |
