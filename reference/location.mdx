## Overview

Locations show the available geographical locations for each of the following cloud providers:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure

Locations are scoped to an [org](/reference/org) and the [org](/reference/org) administrator can turn off/on the locations that are permitted when configuring a [GVC](/reference/gvc).

By default, all locations are enabled. If a location is disabled, any [workloads](/concepts/workload) within that location will be removed. Further, if a location is enabled, all [workloads](/concepts/workload) will be provisioned to that location.

<Note>

If a company is restricted for legal or compliance reasons to only use certain cloud providers, disabling those providers will ensure that workloads will not be deployed to those providers.

</Note>

## Locations

Control Plane can enable any cloud provider location.

If a location is not shown, please email [support@controlplane.com](mailto:support@controlplane.com) with the provider and location and it will be provisioned.

## Custom Locations

CPLN Platform (BYOK) enables you to add new locations by registering your own Kubernetes clusters as locations in the Control Plane platform. 
For a guide on how to create new BYOK locations and further details, [refer to the BYOK documentation](/byok/overview).

## Built-in Tags

Each location has the following built-in [tags](/core/misc#tags):

- `cpln/city=VALUE`
- `cpln/country=VALUE`
- `cpln/continent=VALUE`

## Public IPs

The list of public IPs for each cloud provider and region can be obtained from the following:

- Console UI: The `Locations` page. Select the location to display the IP ranges.
- CLI: Using the command [cpln location get -o json](/cli-reference/commands/location) will list the IPs in the `ipRanges` property. The output can also be formatted in YAML by using the flag `-o yaml-slim`.
- API: Using the `location` endpoint. View the available endpoints [here](/api-reference/location/get-all-locations). The `ipRanges` property will contain the list of SIPs.

<Tip>

The list of IPs may be required by external services that restrict the IPs allowed to call them.

The IPs may change when underlying infrastructure changes. Therefore, Control Plane recommends the automation of querying the location API for changes. In case of changes, the automation should re-configure external services' allowed IP address list.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four [principal types](/concepts/access-control):

| Permission | Description                              | Implies                         |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| create     | Create new locations                     |                                 |
| edit       | Modify existing locations                | view                            |
| manage     | Full access                              | create, edit, manage, use, view |
| use        | Use this location for workload placement | view                            |
| view       | Read-only access                         |                                 |
