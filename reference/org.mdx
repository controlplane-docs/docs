title: Org (Organization)
---

## Overview

An Org serves as a tightly isolated bounded context that encompasses all the resources managed by Control Plane. These resources comprise [domains](/reference/domain), [images](/reference/image), [workloads](/concepts/workload), [GVCs](/reference/gvc), [users](/reference/user), [groups](/reference/group), [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount), and more.

It's possible for a physical organization, to create multiple 'orgs,' although this is not mandatory. Creating multiple orgs can be beneficial in order to establish complete isolation between environments, for instance.

## Create an Org

Refer to the [Create an Org](/guides/create-org) guide.

## Multiple Orgs

A user can be a member of one or more Orgs.

- To switch between Orgs from the console:
  - From the left menu, click on the `>` to the right of the current org.
  - Search or scroll to the desired org.
  - Click on the desired org.

## External Logs / Logging

Control Plane offers the ability to ship all Org logs to an external provider.

Please [click here](/external-logging/overview) for additional details and configuration instructions.

## Endpoint Prefix

All orgs are setup with a random endpoint prefix. It can be found at `{org}.status.endpointPrefix`.
These are used in the workload canonical endpoint and can be configured by the [gvc](/reference/gvc#endpoint-naming-format).

## Tracing

OpenTelemetry traces are supported and can be configured with the native `Control Plane` tracing provider or sent to an OpenTelemetry collector endpoint by using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

### Control Plane Tracing Provider

The Control Plane tracing provider is the default method for collecting OpenTelemetry traces. They will be accessible for exploration using Grafana by accessing the `Traces` link from any workload in the Console.

To enable traces using the Console, navigate to your GVC, click on `Tracing`, and choose `Control Plane` as the metric provider. Then, configure the sampling percentage and, optionally, the Custom Tags.

When using the Control Plane tracing provider, workloads can forward additional Open Telemetry traces to the following endpoints:

GRPC: `tracing.controlplane:80`

HTTP: `tracing.controlplane:4318`

For each of these endpoints, mutual tls is added automatically for requests and any clients/libraries should be configured to send requests using plain text.

Here is an example of an Org with tracing enabled for 10 percent of requests to be forwarded to the Control Plane tracing provider. Additionally, the tag `team`=`profile` will also be added to each trace.

```yaml YAML
kind: org
name: online-boutique
spec:
...
  tracing:
    provider:
      controlPlane: {}
    customTags: {
      team: profile
    }
    sampling: 10
```

### OpenTelemetry Tracing Provider

Similarly, traces can be sent to an OTEL collector endpoint using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

For details, see the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/controlplane-com/examples/blob/main/examples/online-boutique/README.md) example.

## Observability

The retention period for logs, metrics and traces defaults to 30 days and can be adjusted for each independently.

Charges apply for combined storage of logs, metrics and traces over 100GB calculated by GB-Month.

## Threat Detection

Control Plane provides real-time threat detection and alerting by inspecting syscalls of all running workloads using Falco.

There is no action required to enable threat detection, metrics are collected for each detected threat and are used to send notifications.

Threat alert notifications include the GVC, Workload, rule that triggered the alert and priority of the alert.

If Syslog forwarding of threat details is required, it can be configured in the Org settings.

The following list of threats or attempted activities will trigger an alert at the specified severity levels.

#### Notice severity

- Packet socket created
- PTRACE anti-debug
- SSH Activity
- Connect to kubernetes api

#### Info severity

- Spawned processes with an interactive tty

#### Warning severity

- Directory traversal
- Sensitive file read activity
- Netcat remote code execution
- Search for private keys or passwords
- Log file clearing
- Remove data from disk
- Create symlinks\hardlinks to sensitive files
- Kernel module injection
- Debugfs activity
- PTRACE attached
- Credential search activity
- Execution from /dev/shm
- Malicious binaries or script execution

#### Critical severity

- Container escape attempts
- Drop and execute new binary
- Fileless execution using memfd_create
- Crypto currency mining activity

### Threat Detection Metrics

Metrics used for threat alerts are stored in the `threat_detection_alerts` time series.

Labels for this metric are as follows:
- gvc
- workload
- rule (the falco rule that was triggered)
- priority (the severity of the rule triggered)

<Note>only threats with a severity >= `warning` will be alerted by default</Note>

`threat_detection_forward_enable` is set to 1 when Syslog forwarding of alerts is enabled.

`threat_detection_forward_total` is provides a total of all threat events sent to the Syslog target.

### Threat Detection Logs

When alerts are triggered, detailed information is logged to the `_alerts` container for the workload.
These logs can be viewed in the Console by navigating to the workload and clicking on `Logs`, and setting the container to `_alerts`.

## Session Timeout - Console UI

The console UI will automatically sign out if inactive for 15 minutes. This timeout duration is the
default setting (for [PCI compliance](/compliance#pci)) and can be modified.

This timeout setting (in seconds) can be adjusted from the `Info` page when clicking on the `Org` link from the left menu.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission       | Description                                                                    | Implies                                                                                               |
