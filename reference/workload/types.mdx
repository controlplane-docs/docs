## Standard

Standard workloads have greater flexibility in network exposure, but may not scale to zero.

Standard workloads **may**:

- Expose no network endpoint.
- Serve traffic on multiple ports.

Standard workloads **may not**:

- Scale to zero.

## Stateful

### Overview

Stateful workloads are similar to [standard](#standard) and [serverless](#serverless) workloads in many ways. Much of the base functionality, including Universal Cloud Identity, metrics, logs, audit trail, etc. remains the same.

### Replica-Direct Endpoints

By default, stateful workloads (like other types) receive load-balanced endpoints. To enable one endpoint per replica, set `spec.loadBalancer.replicaDirect` to `true`. [Click here](/reference/workload/general#replica-direct-endpoints) to see the endpoint format.

### Capacity AI
Stateful workloads __do not__ support [Capacity AI](/reference/workload/capacity). To optimize costs specify `minCpu` and `minMemory`

### Autoscaling
Stateful workloads __do not__ support concurrency-based horizontal autoscaling.

### Cost Optimization
To reduce costs when using a stateful workload, set `minCpu` and `minMemory` to a low value. These values are used to reserve resources on Control Plane. In Kubernetes parlance, these values are the resource requests

#### `minCpu`
- `minCpu` and `cpu` can be at most 4000m apart
- The ratio between `minCpu` and `cpu` must be at least 1:4

#### `minMemory`
- `minMemory` and `memory` can be at most 4096Mi apart
- The ratio between `minMemory` and `memory` must be at least 1:4

### Key Features

#### Stable Replica Identities

Each replica has a permanent identity. If a replica is rescheduled, restarted, or recreated for any reason, its identity will remain constant. Identities are of the form {`workloadName`}-{`replicaIndex`} e.g. for a workload called my-workload, the replica identities would be:

- my-workload-0
- my-workload-1
- etc.

#### Stable Hostnames

Each replica has a hostname corresponding to its identity. Hostnames are of the form `{replicaIdentity}.{workloadName}` e.g. for a workload called my-workload, the replica hostnames would be:

- my-workload-0.my-workload
- my-workload-1.my-workload
- etc.

So to make an HTTP request to a specific replica, one might execute:

`curl http://my-workload-1.my-workload:8080` from another workload running on Control Plane

#### Persistent Storage

Stateful workloads can mount a [volume set](/reference/volumeset) as a volume in one or more of its containers.
To do this, simply add a volume to a container's list of volumes of the form:

```yaml YAML
uri: cpln://volumeset/my-volume-set
path: /some/mount/directory
```

#### Considerations When Using Persistent Storage

- Volume sets are GVC scoped.
- A workload can only use volume sets in the same GVC.
- A volume set can be used by at most one workload (unless you use the shared file system type)
- A workload may use any number of volume sets.
- The volume set uri must begin with `cpln://volumeset/`.

### Examples

#### PostgreSQL

[This example](https://github.com/controlplane-com/examples/tree/main/examples/postgres) demonstrates how to run a simple postgresql instance on Control Plane.

#### NATS

[This example](https://github.com/controlplane-com/examples/tree/main/examples/nats) demonstrates how to run [NATS](https://nats.io/) on Control Plane.

### Planned Features

- Access to a specific replica via the external endpoint. Currently, the external endpoint load-balances connections across all available replicas.

## Cron

Cron workloads should be used when you need to perform a background task on a regular schedule.

Cron workloads **may not**:

- Serve traffic.
- Scale to zero.
- Include a container that runs indefinitely.

Cron workloads **must**:

- Exit upon completion of the task at hand. Control Plane will start a new replica of your workload at the next scheduled execution time.



### Cron Configuration

<Info>

Cron workloads are always deployed to all locations within their GVC. Unlike workloads of other types, there is no way to provide location-specific configuration overrides.

</Info>

- `job.schedule`
  - A string, which determines how often the cron workload should execute. This field uses the [Kubernetes cron schedule syntax](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#cron-schedule-syntax).
- `job.concurrencyPolicy`
  - This determines what Control Plane will do when a prior execution of your workload is still running when the next scheduled execution time arrives.
    - `Forbid`: subsequent executions will be forgone until the running execution completes.
    - `Replace`: the running execution will be stopped so that a new execution can begin.
    - `Allow`: subsequent executions will be allowed to proceed as normal.
- `job.historyLimit`
  - An integer between 1 and 10 representing the number of prior executions to be retained for reference.
- `job.restartPolicy`
  - Either `Never` or `OnFailure`. This determines whether your workload will be restarted when it fails on execution.
- `job.activeDeadlineSeconds`
  - **Optional**: By default there is no deadline. Job executions are allowed to run indefinitely.
  - If this property is set, this is the maximum number of a seconds a job execution can run. If the job does not exit in the allotted time, Control Plane will remove it.


### Run Now

<Tip>Cron workloads can be run on-demand even when they are suspended.</Tip>

<Info>When running a cron workload on-demand the job.concurrencyPolicy field is ignored.</Info>

Cron workloads can be run on-demand by submitting a `runCronWorkload` command via `POST https://api.cpln.io/org/my-org/gvc/my-gvc/workload/my-cron-workload/-command`

```yaml runCronWorkload Command
type: runCronWorkload
spec:
  location: aws-us-west-2
  containerOverrides:
    - name: my-container
      command: '/bin/sh'
      cpu: '25m'
      memory: '32Mi'
      image: 'ubuntu:latest'
      args:
        - '-c'
        - sleep 10
      env:
        - name: MY_ENV_VAR
          value: some-new-value
```

#### runCronWorkload Spec

- `location`
  - The name of the location as specified in your [GVC](/reference/gvc) configuration.
- `containerOverrides`
  - **Optional**: A list of objects that override specific parts of a container's configuration.
- `containerOverrides[].name`
  - The name of the container to override in the workload specification.
- `containerOverrides[].command`
  - A new command for the container during this execution only. This field corresponds to `workload.containers[].command` in the workload specification.
- `containerOverrides[].cpu`
  - A new CPU configuration for the container during this execution. This field corresponds to `workload.containers[].cpu` in the workload specification.
- `containerOverrides[].memory`
  - A new memory allocation for the container during this execution. This field corresponds to `workload.containers[].memory` in the workload specification.
- `containerOverrides[].image`
  - A new image for the container during this execution. This field corresponds to `workload.containers[].image` in the workload specification.
- `containerOverrides[].args`
  - A new list of arguments for the container during this execution only. This field corresponds to `workload.containers[].args` in the workload specification.
- `containerOverrides[].env`
  - A new list of environment variables for the container during this execution only. This field corresponds to `workload.containers[].env` in the workload specification.

#### Run via the CLI

Run a cron workload using the `cpln` CLI via `cpln workload cron start`. e.g.

<Tip>If you do not specify a location using --location, the CLI will run the workload everywhere it has been deployed.</Tip>

<Info>The --file parameter should contain a list of containerOverrides.</Info>

```shell CLI Example
echo '[{"name":"my-container","command":"/bin/bash","args":["-c","sleep 10"],"env":[{"name":"MY_ENV_VAR","value":"some-new-value"}]}]' | cpln workload cron start cron --gvc my-gvc --org my-org --file -
```

### Job History

A cron workload retains up to `job.historyLimit` job executions in its history. Each job execution will be in one of the following statuses:

- Invalid
- Active
- Success
- Failure
- Removed


#### The Removed Status

The Removed status indicates that a job execution was deleted before it could finish execution. There are several reasons this can happen, but the most common are:

- The `job.concurrencyPolicy` is `Replace` and while the job was still executing, `job.Schedule` dictated that the job should begin again.
- The `job.activeDeadlineSeconds` limit was exceeded.

## Serverless

Serverless workloads should be used for web applications that serve traffic on a single port, but may not need to run 100% of the time.

Serverless workloads **may**:

- Scale to zero.

Serverless workloads **may not**:

- Serve traffic on multiple ports.

Serverless workloads **must**:

- Expose a network endpoint.
