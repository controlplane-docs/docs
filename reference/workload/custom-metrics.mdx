title: Custom Metrics

# Metrics

Control Plane can collect custom metrics from your workload by having your application emit a [Prometheus formatted list of metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/) at a path and port of your choosing. The port can be different than the one serving traffic. Each container in a workload can be configured with metrics.

<Tip>

The convention is to use the path `/metrics`, but any path can be used.

</Tip>

Sample output from the metrics endpoint:

```
MY_COUNTER 788
MY_COUNTER_2 123
NUM_USERS 2
NUM_ORDERS 91
```

The platform will scrape all the replicas in the workload every 30 seconds with a 5 second timeout. Metric names with the prefix `cpln_` will be ignored by the scrapping process.

The collected metrics can be viewed by clicking the `Metrics` link on the workload page within the console. Clear any existing query and enter the name of the metric. Click `Run Query` to execute.

The time-series displayed will include these labels:

- `org`
- `gvc`
- `location`
- `provider`
- `region`
- `cluster_id`
- `replica`

## Metrics - Configuring Custom Metrics Scraping

1. In the UI, navigate to `Workloads` in the selected GVC and select the workload for which you want to scrape metrics.
2. Select the appropriate container name under `Containers`, then choose `Metrics`.
3. Configure the `Path` and `Port` where the container serves metrics, then save the settings.
4. The workload will automatically redeploy to apply the changes. Metrics will be collected once the rollout is complete.

All objects in the UI can be exported to YAML, JSON, or Terraform formats by clicking `Actions` and selecting `Export`.
