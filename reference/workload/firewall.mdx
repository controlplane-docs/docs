# Firewall

<Info>

Inbound network access is only available for workloads of types `serverless` and `standard`. For other workload types, only outbound firewall settings are relevant.

</Info>

## External

The external firewall is used to control Internet traffic to/from a workload.

### Inbound Requests

- By default, all inbound requests are disabled.
- Access is granted by explicitly adding one or more IPv4 / IPv6 / [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) addresses or allowing all addresses.
- Using the UI:
  - Multiple address can entered within the textbox by delimiting each address with either a comma or space.
  - An import file can be uploaded containing each address on its own line or delimited with either a comma or space.

<Tip>

The CIDR address `0.0.0.0/0` allows full inbound access from the public Internet.

</Tip>

### Outbound Requests

- By default, all outbound requests are disabled.
- Access is granted by explicitly adding one or more IPv4 / IPv6 / [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) addresses or public hostnames or allowing all addresses / hostnames.
  - **When using a hostname, only ports 80, 443, and 445 will be reachable. To allow all ports, enable all outbound requests.**
  - When using a IP or CIDR, all ports will be reachable.
- The IP/CIDR addresses takes precedence over hostnames.
- Using the UI:
  - Multiple address can entered within the textbox by delimiting each address with either a comma or space.
  - An import file can be uploaded containing each address on its own line or delimited with either a comma or space.

<Tip>

The CIDR address `0.0.0.0/0` allows full outbound access to the public Internet.

## Internal

The internal firewall is used to control access between other workloads within an [org](/reference/org). Only the ports listed in the workload containers array will be made accessible to other workloads.

**Available Options:**

- `None`: No access is allowed between workloads.
- `Same GVC`: Workloads running in the same [GVC](/reference/gvc) are accessible.
- `Same Org`: Workloads running in the same [org](/reference/org) are accessible.
- `Specific Workloads`: Specific workloads are allowed access this workload.
  - These workloads can be from the same or different GVCs.
  - The user configuring this setting must have the `view` permission, set within a [policy](/reference/policy#permissions), on the workload being specified.
- `Allow to Access Itself`: Enables replicas of this workload to access themselves.
