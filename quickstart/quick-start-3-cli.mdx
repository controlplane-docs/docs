title: 3. Getting Started with the CLI
---

## Overview

Control Plane offers a [Command Line Interface](/reference/cli) for all major operating systems. The [CLI](/reference/cli) is an abstraction layer over the Control Plane [API](/reference/api) and gives you access to all the features of the platform.

It is recommended to install the [CLI](/reference/cli) in order to perform a handful of operations that are not available from the console (e.g., containerizing a microservice).

This quick start will demonstrate how to:

- Install the [CLI](/reference/cli#install-npm).
- Log in to the [CLI](/reference/cli#login).
- Display the Control Plane resources created in the previous [Quick Start](/quickstart/quick-start-1-deploy-workload).
- Set a default [Org](/reference/org) and [GVC](/reference/gvc) in your [profile](/guides/cli/manage-profile).

## Prerequisites

- [Deploy Your First Workload](/sample-application) Quick Start.

## Step One - Install the CLI

The preferred method to install the [CLI](/reference/cli) is using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) with Node.js version 12+. Alternate methods to install the [CLI](/reference/cli) are available [here](/reference/cli#install-binary).

After installing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), open a new shell window and execute the following command to install the [CLI](/reference/cli):

```bash
npm install -g @controlplane/cli
```

After a successful installation, run the following command to view the installed version:

```bash
cpln --version
```

The latest version can be viewed [here](/release-notes#latest-versions) and cross referenced with the output from the --version flag.

## Step Two - Log in to the CLI

The [CLI](/reference/cli) requires you to log in before executing any commands.

Open a new shell and execute this command to log in:

```bash
cpln login
```

The default browser will launch displaying the login page. Select the single sign-on (SSO) provider that is connected to your email address. After a successful log in, the brower can be closed. The shell will display the [profile](/guides/cli/manage-profile) named `default` that was created and mapped to your email address.

## Step Three - Display Control Plane Resources

You can use the [CLI](/reference/cli) to view the resources that were created in the previous [Quick Start](/quickstart/quick-start-1-deploy-workload).

Execute the commands below to view their respective output (substitute ORG_NAME and GVC_NAME for your [Org](/reference/org) and [GVC](/reference/gvc) name):

<CodeGroup>

```bash Get all your Orgs
cpln org get
```

```bash Get all your GVCs
cpln gvc get --org ORG_NAME
```

```bash Get all your Workloads
cpln workload get --org ORG_NAME --gvc GVC_NAME
```

</CodeGroup>

To view all the commands that the [CLI](/reference/cli) offers, run:

```
cpln --help
```

Each command displayed in the `--help` output also has its own `--help` output. To view it, run:

```
cpln COMMAND --help
```

## Step Four - Set a default Org and GVC

Notice that in [step 3](#step-three-display-control-plane-resources) the [GVC](/reference/gvc) and [Workload](/reference/workload) commands required additional flags for the [Org](/reference/org) and [GVC](/reference/gvc).

By setting a default [Org](/reference/org) and/or [GVC](/reference/gvc) on your [profile](/guides/manage-profile), those flags will not be needed in future [CLI](/reference/cli) command calls.

To set a default [Org](/reference/org) or [GVC](/reference/gvc) on your [profile](/guides/manage-profile), run the following command (substitute ORG_NAME and GVC_NAME for your [Org](/reference/org) and [GVC](/reference/gvc) name):

```bash
cpln profile update default --org ORG_NAME --gvc GVC_NAME
```

## Summary

By installing the [CLI](/reference/cli), you have the ability to easily interact with the platform and execute commands quickly.

Visit the [CLI reference](/reference/cli) page for details and examples of each command.
