title: 2. Configure a Custom Domain
---

## Overview

This quick start will demonstrate how to:

- Create and configure a [domain](/reference/domain) resource within Control Plane using both path and subdomain based routing to serve requests to your workload.
- Review and test your configured [domain](/reference/domain).

## Prerequisites

- A running [Workload](/reference/workload). If you don't have one, follow this [Quick Start](/quickstart/quick-start-1-deploy-workload).
- Access to a domain name and the ability to update its DNS records.

## Step One - Register your APEX Domain

An apex domain, also known as a root domain, refers to a domain name that does not have any subdomain prefix (e.g., **example.com**).

Even if the apex domain isn't served at Control Plane, it needs to be created and configured for verification. This verification is done by adding a TXT record to DNS.

For this quick start guide, we'll set up the apex domain solely for verification, without configuring any routing.

<Tip>As a best practice, create the apex domain in the Org designated for your production environment.</Tip>

1. Create a new [Domain](/reference/domain) resource by using one of the following methods:

   - Clicking `Domains` in the left menu and click `New`, or
   - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `Domain`.

2. The console will prompt for the domain name (e.g., **example.com**). Enter your apex domain and click `Continue`.

3. The console will display the necessary TXT record to be added to DNS. Once you've added it, wait a few minutes for it to propagate online. Afterward, press the "I Configured DNS, Continue" button to allow Control Plane to verify the apex domain.

4. After verification, the console will default to show the configuration for `Path Based Routing`. Since the apex domain will not be routed to a workload, click the `Edit` button to the right of `DNS & ROUTING MODES`, then click `Advanced Mode`, then click `Show More Options`.

5. Select `None` for the `Routing Mode`, and click `Continue`.

6. The console will show the default setting for advanced mode. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click `Create`.

Your APEX domain has been successfully created at Control Plane and sub-domains of the apex domain can now be created.

## Step Two - Review Routing Modes

Control Plane provides two routing modes for directing requests to your domain. Read the descriptions below to determine the best mode for your needs.

1. **Path Routing**

   - A CNAME records is added to DNS.
   - Best choice when path based routing is required.
   - You maintain full control of DNS for the domain.
   - CDN / WAF Compatible.
   - Examples:
     - **https://sub.example.com/workload_one**
     - **https://sub.example.com/workload_two**
   - Refer to [Step Three](#step-three-configure-path-routing) for configuration instructions.

2. **Subdomain Routing**

   - NS records are added to your DNS to delegate DNS to Control Plane for this domain **only**.
   - Best choice when a unique DNS subdomain is required for each workload.
   - One-time configuration.
   - Works for all current and future workloads in a GVC.
   - Examples:
     - **https://workload_one.sub.example.com**
     - **https://workload_two.sub.example.com**
   - Refer to [Step Four](#step-four-configure-subdomain-routing) for configuration instructions.

## Step Three - Configure Path Routing

1. Create a new [domain](/reference/domain) resource by using one of the following methods:

   - Clicking `Domains` in the left menu and click `New`, or
   - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `Domain`.

2. The console will prompt for the desired domain name (e.g., **sub.example.com**). Click `Continue`.

3. The console will display the two routing modes. Click `Use CNAME Record & Path Routing`.

4. The console will prompt you to select the GVC which contains the workload that the domain will be routed to.

5. Once the GVC is selected, the console will prompt you to select the workload. After the workload is selected, click `Continue`.

6. The required CNAME record will be displayed. This record will need to be added by the person who is responsible for maintaining DNS for the domain. After adding it, allow a few minutes for propagation across the Internet. Click the `I have created the DNS record` checkbox and then click `Create`.

<Note>

Control Plane won't verify the CNAME record. Certificate generation and routing will only commence once the record is added, and the chosen workload is in a ready state, capable of accepting requests from the Internet.

**Tip:** When adding the domain using GoDaddy, the minimum TTL is 600.

</Note>

Your domain has been successfully created at Control Plane and will serve the selected workload on the path `"/"` once DNS is updated and the certificates have been generated.

Additional routes and advanced domain configuration options are available by clicking the `Edit` link and clicking the `Advanced Mode` button. For additional details on path based routing, click [here](/reference/domain#path-based-routing).

## Step Four - Configure Subdomain Routing

1. Create a new [domain](/reference/domain) resource by using one of the following methods:

   - Clicking `Domains` in the left menu and click `New`, or
   - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `Domain`.

2. The console will prompt for the desired domain name (e.g., **sub.example.com**). Click `Continue`.

3. The console will display the two routing modes. Click `Use NS Records & Subdomain Routing`.

4. The console will prompt you to select the GVC which contains the workloads that the domain will be routed to. Click `Continue`.

5. The required NS records will be displayed. These records will need to be added by the person who is responsible for maintaining DNS for the domain. After adding it, allow a few minutes for propagation across the Internet. Click the `I have created the DNS record` checkbox and then click `Create`.

<Note>

Control Plane won't verify the NS records. Certificate generation and routing will only commence once the records are added, and the chosen workload is in a ready state, capable of accepting requests from the Internet.

**Tip:** When adding the domain using GoDaddy, the minimum TTL is 600.

</Note>

Your domain has been successfully created at Control Plane and will serve all the workloads within the GVC using the pattern: `https://WORKLOAD_NAME.sub.example.com`.

Advanced domain configuration options are available by clicking the `Edit` link and clicking the `Advanced Mode` button. For additional details on subdomain routing, click [here](/reference/domain#subdomain-based-routing).

## Step Five - Review and Test Domains

1. In the left menu, click on `Workloads` and choose the workload specified during the domain configuration. If your org has multiple GVCs, ensure the GVC currently selected matches the one chosen during the domain configuration.

2. The [Workload](/reference/workload) `Info` page will be displayed which includes the list of URLs that will route to this workload.

   - **Internal Name:** Use this URL to call another workload within your Org. See the [service-to-service quick start](/quickstart/quick-start-5-service-to-service-calls) for more information.
   - **Canonical Endpoint (Global):** This URL uses the default Control Plane domain `cpln.app` and is typically used for troubleshooting or when there is no domain serving the workload.
   - The rest of the list displays the URLs configured for path-based or subdomain-based routing.
   - This list of URLs are automatically secured using TLS certificates, load balanced, and DNS geo-routed to the nearest healthy [Location](/reference/location).

3. Click `Deployments`. This page shows the providers this [Workload](/reference/workload) is deployed to. Next to each provider is the location specific URL. Clicking the `Open` link will load the [Workload](/reference/workload) only in that [Location](/reference/location). These links can be used for troubleshooting.

## Summary

By taking the step to configure your custom domain enables a secure and reliable pathway to access your [Workload](/reference/workload). This not only enhances the integrity and reliability of your operations but also ensures that every interaction is seamlessly aligned with the identity and branding of your organization. This practice fosters trust and consistency, especially when dealing with external stakeholders or customers who recognize and resonate with your brand's identity.
