title: 5. Service-to-Service Calls
---

## Overview

Multiple [Workloads](/reference/workload) can be deployed to Control Plane that have a dependency on one another. By default, [Workloads](/reference/workload) are hardened and don't allow any access from other [Workloads](/reference/workload). Using the [internal firewall](/reference/workload#internal) settings, secure access (using mTLS) from other [Workloads](/reference/workload) can be enabled. This quick start will focus on allowing internal service-to-service calls between [Workloads](/reference/workload).

This quick start will demonstrate how to:

- Set up two [Workloads](/reference/workload) with a sample application.
- Configure a [Workloads'](/reference/workload) [internal firewall](/reference/workload#internal) to accept requests from other [Workloads](/reference/workload).
- Prove, using the sample application, that requests are only received by allowed [Workloads](/reference/workload).

## Prerequisites

- [Permissions](/reference/policy#permissions) to:

  - Create and edit a [GVC](/reference/gvc).
  - Create and edit a [Workloads](/reference/workload).

- Latest [CLI](/reference/cli#installation) installed.

## Sample Application

A sample application for this quick start is available as an image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) that will display the following:

- [GVC](/reference/gvc) name.
- Cloud provider location.
- [Workload](/reference/workload) name.
- Response from a call to another URL (using the `url` query string parameter).
- The image is located at: `cplnquickstarts/service-to-service-quick-start:1.1`.

The source code for the sample application can be viewed [here](https://github.com/controlplane-com/examples/tree/main/quickstarts/5/service-to-service-quick-start).

## Step One - Create GVC and Two Workloads

1. Authenticate to Control Plane by executing the following [CLI](/reference/cli) command:

```
cpln login
```

2. Execute the following [CLI](/reference/cli) command to update your profile with a default [Org](/reference/org) which will be used by the subsequent commands (substitute ORG_NAME for your org):

```
cpln profile update default --org ORG_NAME
```

3. Execute the following [CLI](/reference/cli) command to create a [GVC](/reference/gvc) that will contain the two [Workloads](/reference/workload):

```
cpln gvc create --name quick-start-service-to-service --location aws-us-west-2
```

The [GVC](/reference/gvc) created is named `quick-start-service-to-service` and will be hosted at AWS within the us-west-2 region.

---

4. Execute the following [CLI](/reference/cli) command to create the two [Workloads](/reference/workload) that will be hosting the sample application.

**Note:** The [cpln apply](/guides/cli/cpln-apply) command is used to create the [Workloads](/reference/workload) that are defined in the YAML manifest file. The file can be viewed by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/controlplane-com/examples/main/quickstarts/5/01_create_workloads.yaml).

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/controlplane-com/examples/main/quickstarts/5/01_create_workloads.yaml | cpln apply -f - --gvc quick-start-service-to-service
```

The first [Workload](/reference/workload) is named `server` and the second is named `client`. They are both configured with the sample application image and the firewall rules has been set to allow outside traffic.

---

5. Browse to the `server` [Workload](/reference/workload) using the [Console](https://console.cpln.io/):

   - Select the [GVC](/reference/gvc) named `quick-start-service-to-service`.
   - Click `Workloads` in the left menu and select `server`.

Once the `Workload Health` shows `Ready`, click on the `Open` link next to the `Global Endpoint` URL. A new browser tab will open and display the following:

```
Hello! Version: 1.1

GVC Name: quick-start-service-to-service
Location: /org/ORG_NAME/location/aws-us-west-2
Workload Name: /org/ORG_NAME/gvc/quick-start-service-to-service/workload/server

Response from URL:

No URL in querystring
```

## Step Two - Demonstrate a Failed Request

1. Browse to the `client` [Workload](/reference/workload) using the [Console](https://console.cpln.io/):
   - Click `Workloads` in the left menu and select `client`.

Once the `Workload Health` shows `Ready`, click on the `Open` link next to the `Global Endpoint` URL. A new browser tab will open and display the output similar to step 1, but showing the second [Workload](/reference/workload) name `client`.

The sample application can call another URL endpoint by using the `url` query string parameter. Since the `client` will be calling the `server`, the URL will follow the [Service Endpoint Syntax](/guides/configure-resources/service-to-service#service-endpoint-syntax).

From the new browser tab, test the call to the first service by browsing to:

```
https://GLOBAL_ENDPOINT_CLIENT_WORKLOAD/?url=http://server.quick-start-service-to-service.cpln.local
```

Since we haven't changed the [internal firewall](/reference/workload#internal) rules, the response from the sample application will display the following (indicating that the `client` cannot connect to the `server`):

```
Hello! Version: 1.1

GVC Name: quick-start-service-to-service
Location: /org/ORG_NAME/location/aws-us-west-2
Workload Name: /org/ORG_NAME/gvc/quick-start-service-to-service/workload/client

Response from URL:

Request failed with status code 502
```

Leave this browser tab open. It will be used in [step three](#step-three-configure-internal-firewall).

## Step Three - Configure Internal Firewall

Execute the following [CLI](/reference/cli) command to update the firewall rules of the `server` [Workload](/reference/workload) to grant inbound access from any [Workload](/reference/workload) in the same [GVC](/reference/gvc):

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/controlplane-com/examples/main/quickstarts/5/02_update_first_workload_firewall.yaml | cpln apply -f - --gvc quick-start-service-to-service
```

The YAML file can be viewed by clicking [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/controlplane-com/examples/main/quickstarts/5/02_update_first_workload_firewall.yaml).

Notice that the [internal firewall](/reference/workload#internal) configuration has been set to the allow type of `same-gvc`.

## Step Four - Test the Updated Firewall Rule

1. In the browser tab that was opened for [step two](#step-two-demonstrate-a-failed-request), we should still have the failed response displayed.
2. Refresh the page and the following response will be displayed (it might take a minute or two for the new deployment to complete):

```
Hello! Version: 1.1

GVC Name: quick-start-service-to-service
Location: /org/ORG_NAME/location/aws-us-west-2
Workload Name: /org/ORG_NAME/gvc/quick-start-service-to-service/workload/client

Response from URL:
---
Hello! Version: 1.1

GVC Name: quick-start-service-to-service
Location: /org/ORG_NAME/location/aws-us-west-2
Workload Name: /org/ORG_NAME/gvc/quick-start-service-to-service/workload/server

Response from URL:

No URL in querystring
```

<Tip>
  If you received the same response, this demonstrated that the `client` [Workload](/reference/workload) was able to call the `server`
  [Workload](/reference/workload) internally.
</Tip>

# Configure Other Internal Firewall Rules

In [step three](#step-three-configure-internal-firewall), the [internal firewall](/reference/workload#internal) rule for the `server` [Workload](/reference/workload) was set to allow access from any [Workload](/reference/workload) in the same [GVC](/reference/gvc).

The rule can also be set to:

- Allow access ONLY from specific [Workloads](/reference/workload). These [Workloads](/reference/workload) can be from the same or different [GVCs](/reference/gvc). The user configuring this setting must have the `view` permission, set within a [policy](/reference/policy#permissions), on the [Workload](/reference/workload) being specified.
- Allow access from **any** [Workloads](/reference/workload) within the same [Org](/reference/org), crossing [GVC](/reference/gvc) boundaries.

Please experiment with the other settings using the sample application to verify that the [internal firewall](/reference/workload#internal) rules are enforced. Remember that any changes to the firewall rules will be updated within a minute and a deployment of the [Workload](/reference/workload) will be queued. Please allow a few minutes between tests.

# Summary

Using a sample application that can call endpoints from within a [Workload](/reference/workload), we were able to demonstrate that a [Workload](/reference/workload) is locked down by default and will not accept any requests internally.

By setting the [internal firewall](/reference/workload#internal) rule, [Workloads](/reference/workload) can allow different types of internal traffic from other [Workloads](/reference/workload). Depending on the use case, multiple [Workloads](/reference/workload) can be deployed within your [Org](/reference/org) and call each other internally without having to access the public Internet.
