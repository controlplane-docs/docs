## [Overview](#overview)


[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a robust and comprehensive monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing full visibility into IT infrastructure. The service combines metrics and events from servers, databases, applications, tools, and services to present a unified view of an entire stack.
 
 
Datadog is capable of ingesting, analyzing, and visualizing logs from a variety
of sources, including servers. This feature is a part of Datadog's Log
Management solution, which provides essential capabilities such as real-time log
tailing and filtering, log analytics, and detailed visualizations. It can handle
a wide range of log formats, including but not limited to, JSON, syslog, and
common application logs.
 
 
Datadog offers capabilities for log retention and archiving, enabling compliance with various regulatory standards.
It also supports role-based access controls to secure your logs and control who can access what information.
 
 
Follow the steps below to configure log shipping to Datadog.

## [Step 1 - Credential Procurement](#credential-procurement)

An API key is required to ship logs to Datadog.

Follow these steps to obtain the API key, store it as an [Opaque Secret](/api-reference/secret#opaque), and
configure external logging.

1. From the Datadog dashboard, hover over your username at the bottom of the left menu and click `Organization Settings`.
2. In the middle menu, click `API Keys`.
3. Click the `New Key` button in the upper right corner, enter a key name, and click `Create Key`.
4. Click the `Copy Key` button. This will copy the key to your clipboard. Click the `X` to close the modal.
5. From the Control Plane Console UI, click `Secrets` from the left menu.
6. Click the `New` button.
7. Enter a `Name` for the secret, and select `Opaque` from the `Secret Type` list.
8. Paste the string from step #4 into the content text box and click `Create`.
9. This secret will be used when configuring logging using the [UI Console](#logging-ui) or [CLI](#logging-cli).

## [Step 2 - Configure External Logging](#configure-external-logging)

External logging can be configured by using either the [UI Console](#logging-ui) or [CLI](#logging-cli).

### [Enable Logging using the UI Console](#logging-ui)

1. From the Control Plane Console UI, click on `Org` in the left menu.
2. Click `External Logs` in the middle context menu.
3. Select `Datadog` and fill out the required fields.
4. Select the Opaque secret created to authenticate to Datadog. Refer to the [credential procurement](#credential-procurement) section to obtain and configure the necessary credentials.
5. Click `Save`.
6. After the configuration is complete, log entries will be available at Datadog within a few minutes.

<Tip>
The hostname will be similar to the domain name that resolves when using the Datadog dashboard.
(i.e., The host `http-intake.logs.us3.datadoghq.com` maps to the dashboard domain `us3.datadoghq.com`)
</Tip>

### [Enable Logging using the CLI](#logging-cli)

The external logging configuration can be created / updated using the CLI's `cpln org patch ORG_NAME -f FILE.yaml` command.

Below is an example Org manifests (in YAML). Edit and save the YAML as a file and use it as an input to the CLI's `cpln org patch ORG_NAME -f FILE.yaml` command.

Refer to the [credential procurement](#credential-procurement) section to obtain and configure the necessary credentials.

- Substitute: ORG_NAME, OPAQUE_SECRET, and possibly the host.
- **Note:** Use the host URL that matches your Datadog account. The host will be a similar domain name that resolves when using the Datadog dashboard.

```
kind: org
name: ORG_NAME
spec:
  logging:
    datadog:
      host: http-intake.logs.us3.datadoghq.com
      credentials: //secret/OPAQUE_SECRET
```
