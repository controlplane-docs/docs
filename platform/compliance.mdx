## PCI

### Control Plane is Level 1 PCI DSS compliant

Stripe is the payment information and credit card processing provider used by Control Plane.
Security is a top priority for Control Plane, and as such, we have invested significant resources to obtain and

### What is PCI?

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a security standard for organizations
that handle credit and debit card information. The standard was created to increase controls around payment data and reduce fraud. If you want to sell
online and accept payments from Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover, your software and hosting needs to be PCI compliant.

### Security as a Company Value

Guided by Control Plane’s security and compliance principles, we deliver products and services that enable simple, secure access to the digital world.

### Secure Personnel

Control Plane prioritizes the security of its own data as well as that of its clients and customers, ensuring that only vetted personnel have access to these resources.

* All Control Plane contractors and employees undergo background checks prior to being engaged or employed by us in accordance with local laws and industry best practices.

* Confidentiality or other types of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) are signed by all employees, contractors, and others who have a need to access sensitive or internal information.

* We foster a culture of security across our company by continuously training and testing our employees on the latest and emerging security techniques and attack vectors.

### Secure Development

* All development projects at Control Plane, including on-premises software products, support services, and our own Digital Identity Cloud offerings, follow secure development lifecycle principles.

* All development of new products, tools, services, and major changes to existing ones, undergo a design review to ensure security requirements are incorporated into proposed development.

* All team members regularly involved in any system development undergo annual secure development training in coding or scripting languages that they work with, as well as any other relevant training.

* Software development is conducted in line with OWASP Top 10 recommendations for web application security.

### Secure Testing

Control Plane deploys third-party penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of all production and Internet facing systems on a regular basis.

* All new systems and services are scanned prior to being deployed to production.

* All new and existing systems, products, services, and updates are thoroughly evaluated from multiple perspectives. Leveraging external penetration testing and our top-tier internal security engineers, we provide users with a comprehensive and real-world view of all Control Plane products and environments.

* We perform static and dynamic software application security testing of all code, including open-source libraries, as part of our software development process.

### Cloud Security

Control Plane's cloud provides maximum security with complete customer isolation in a modern, multi-tenant cloud architecture.

Control Plane's cloud leverages the native physical and network security features of the cloud service and relies on the providers to maintain the infrastructure, services, and physical access policies and procedures.

* All customer cloud environments and data are isolated using Control Plane’s patented isolation approach. Each customer environment is stored within a dedicated trust zone to prevent any accidental or malicious co-mingling.

* All data is also encrypted at rest and in transmission to prevent any unauthorized access and data breaches. Our entire platform is continuously monitored by dedicated, highly trained Control Plane experts.

* We separate each customer's data and our own, utilizing unique encryption keys to ensure data is protected and isolated.

* Client’s data protection complies with SOC 2 standards to encrypt data in transit and at rest, ensuring customer and company data and sensitive information are protected at all times.

* We implement role-based access controls and the principles of least privileged access, and review revoke access as needed.
