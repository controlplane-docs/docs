title: Access Control
---

## Overview

Access control is handled in two separate ways on the Control Plane Platform. One is for billing accounts, and the other is for orgs.

Billing account has only three roles, `billing_admin`, `billing_viewer` and `org_creator`. You can invite a user to a billing account with these roles.

For access control on orgs, there is a policy system in place that is more advanced, which relies on principals and bindings. See [policy](/objects/policy) for detail.

## Principals

A “principal” is somewhat of an overloaded term representing an “identity”.

The Control Plane Platform supports four principal types.

Each principal type is scoped to an org and can be granted permissions to certain items or a kind through policies.

- [Users](/reference/user)

A user represents a distinct human being. This principal type is associated with an email. A user is a member of one or more orgs. An authorized principal can invite users to an org (by providing their email address).

- [Service Accounts](/reference/serviceaccount)

A service account is a non-human, often an application that is utilized to consume the API.

- [Groups](/reference/group)

A group is a named collection of users and service accounts. When inviting users to an org, a group can optionally be assigned to the inviting users. A group can also target users dynamically using a query.

- [Identity](/reference/identity)

An identity is short for workload identity. It is a reusable (can be leveraged by multiple workloads) named principal that is only used by workloads. An identity encapsulates a set of [Cloud Access](/objects/identity#cloud-access-universal-cloud-identity) rules. Cloud Access rules define least privilege policies governing access to resources in the org's configured cloud accounts. In addition to Cloud Access rules, an identity also defines a set of [Network Resources](/reference/identity#network-resources-cloud-wormhole).

## Examples

* To allow a user or group access to perform actions within the console, an administrator would create a policy that bounds the user or group to the resource and the necessary permissions.

* To allow a workload the ability to access secured resources within Control Plane (e.g., a secret used as an environment variable), an administrator creates a policy that assigns the necessary permissions to the user or group for the specified resource.
