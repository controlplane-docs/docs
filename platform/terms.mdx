## Kind

Each object in Control Plane Platform belongs to a kind. These are the fundamental pieces you will create, manage and design the relationship between, such as `Workload`, `VolumeSet`, `Agent`, `Service Account` and more.

Each instance of a kind is referred to as `item` in the platform. Our API drives all of the other clients (`Terraform Provider`, `UI Console`, `CPLN CLI`) and when a request is made to our API, it will usually act on a single item or multiple items (`instances of a kind`).

## Context

All of the clients work better within a context, which is a pair of an `org` item, and a `gvc` item. This makes it easier for the clients to refer to items within an org/gvc.

Some kinds are scoped to a gvc, while others are scoped to an org. `Workload`, `Identity`, and `VolumeSet` kinds are scoped under gvc, while all other kinds are scoped under org.

## Links

Each `item` is accessible by its link. This is a url/address for the `item` and is an essential part of the platform. There are two ways to structure the link of an item, which is called a `selfLink`. These types are `fullLink` and `relativeLink`. When a kind is scoped to a gvc, its relative link must include gvc name.

<Note>Relative link relies on the `context` set in the client that is being used.</Note>

See examples for different possibilities such as gvc or org scoped items.

| Kind     | Item Name  | Full Link                                | Relative Link                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Org      | myorg      | /org/myorg                               | NA                              |
| Secret   | mysecret   | /org/myorg/secret/mysecret               | //secret/mysecret               |
| GVC      | mygvc      | /org/myorg/gvc/mygvc                     | //gvc/mygvc                     |
| Workload | myworkload | /org/myorg/gvc/mygvc/workload/myworkload | //gvc/mygvc/workload/myworkload |

## Clients

There are multiple ways to use the platform, which are our `clients`. Such as the UI Console, CPLN API, CPLN CLI, Terraform Provider Plugin, Pulumi.

## Containers

Refer to the [Kubernetes containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/) concepts page.

## Grafana Alerts

Alerts can be created from the Org's Grafana instance. Refer to these [instructions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/unified-alerting/alerting-rules/create-grafana-managed-rule/) on how to create a Grafana managed alert.

### Built-in Alert Rules

The Grafana instance accessed via the "Metrics" link of your Workload comes with several automatically provisioned objects, including built-in alert rules. These rules can send notifications to one or several of your preferred contact points (e.g., email). By default, notifications for these alerts are disabled. To receive notifications, you must add a contact point (refer to the Grafana [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/fundamentals/notifications/contact-points/)).

You can find the built-in alert rules in your Grafana instance under `Alerts` > `Alert rules`:

- `container-restarts`

  - This alert triggers if any of your workloads restart repeatedly. Specifically, it activates if the Control Plane custom metric `container_restarts` is greater than 1 in the last 5 minutes.

- `stuck-deployments`

  - This alert triggers if any of your deployments are stuck.
  - It checks for multiple container restarts within specific groups (gvc and workload). If any group exceeds one restart in the last 15 minutes, it triggers an alert.

To edit or create new alerts, go to the `Alerts` > `Alert rules` section in your Grafana instance.

If you edit built-in alerts, your changes will be saved. However, if you delete any built-in alerts, they will be recreated automatically the next time you log in to Grafana.

To disable built-in alerts, edit the corresponding alert rule and turn on the `Pause evaluation` toggle in the alert editing view.

## Public IPs

The list of public IPs for each cloud provider and region can be obtained.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Console UI">
    Navigate to `Locations` list page from the main navigation bar.
    Select a location and you will see the ip ranges are listed in the `info` page.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Use the command below to view ip ranges of all locations.

    ```bash
      cpln location get -o json
    ```

    The output can also be formatted in YAML by using the flag `-o yaml` instead of `-o json`

    To view a single location, use the command below by replacing the `{locationName}` with a correct value.

    ```bash
      cpln location get {locationName} -o json
    ```

    See more details by clicking [here](/references/cli#location).

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="API">
    Location list endpoint or location specific endpoint returns the location object with `ipRanges` property.

    Click [here](/references/api/location/get-all-locations) for details.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>

The list of IPs may be required by external services that restrict the IPs allowed to call them.

The IPs may change when underlying infrastructure changes. Therefore, Control Plane recommends the automation of querying the location API for changes. In case of changes, the automation should re-configure external servicesâ€™ allowed IP address list.

</Tip>

## Workload Deployment Errors

- `Error: exitCode: 1 message: standard_init_linux.go:228: exec user process caused: exec format error`
  - The incorrect platform was used to build the configured image. Control Plane requires the image target `amd64`. Refer to the [Push an Image Guide](/guides/push-image#step-2-build-a-new-image-using-docker-and-a-dockerfile-optional) for additional details.
