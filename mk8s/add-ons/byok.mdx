title: CPLN Platform

## Overview

Turn your Kubernetes cluster into a BYOK location by enabling the CPLN Platform add-on.
This allows you to use the Control Plane Platform to manage the cluster.

## How to Enable

The CPLN Platform add-on can be enabled for your Kubernetes cluster either during the cluster creation process or at any time thereafter. The following sections outline the methods for enabling the add-on:

### At Cluster Creation

- **Through Cluster Manifest**: Add the following snippet to your cluster manifest when creating the cluster:

  ```yaml YAML
  spec:
    ...
    addOns:
      byok: {
        location: //location/<your-location>
      }
    ...
  ```

- **Using the Console**: If you're creating the cluster through the console, navigate to `Add-ons`, find the `CPLN Platform` add-on in the list of available add-ons, and toggle it on.

### After Cluster Creation

If the CPLN Platform add-on was not enabled during the cluster creation, you can still enable it using either method.

## Uninstall Procedure
To uninstall BYOK from a cluster, follow this guide: [Uninstall Procedure](/byok/overview#uninstall-procedure)
## Configuration

The CPLN Platform add-on supports extensive configuration options to customize the behavior of various components. Below is a brief overview of available settings along with links to the comprehensive guides:

### Top-level Configuration

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ignoreUpdates` | boolean | Whether to ignore automatic software updates from the Control Plane Platform |
| `location` | string | **Required.** The CPLN Platform location link (e.g., `//location/<location-name>`) |

### Component Configurations

#### Actuator Configuration

**Path:** `byok.config.actuator`

The Actuator component receives events from Control Plane and uses the metadata provided in the events to instantiate the desired configuration on the kubernetes cluster. This can be Kubernetes deployments, domain routing configuration, storage devices, etc.

See [Actuator Settings](/byok/settings/actuator) for all available options.

#### Additional CPLN PLatform Options

See [CPLN Platform Settings](/byok/settings/agent#general-configurations) for a detailed description of additional settings.

### Notes

- The `location` field is required and must be set to a valid CPLN BYOK location.
- You CANNOT change the `location` field after it has been set
