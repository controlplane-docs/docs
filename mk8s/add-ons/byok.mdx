title: CPLN Platform
---

## Overview

Turn your Kubernetes cluster into a BYOK location by enabling the CPLN Platform add-on.
This allows you to use the Control Plane Platform to manage the cluster.

## How to Enable

The CPLN Platform add-on can be enabled for your Kubernetes cluster either during the cluster creation process or at any time thereafter. The following sections outline the methods for enabling the add-on:

### At Cluster Creation

- **Through Cluster Manifest**: Add the following snippet to your cluster manifest when creating the cluster:

  ```yaml YAML
  spec:
    ...
    addOns:
      byok: {
        location: //location/<your-location>
      }
    ...
  ```

- **Using the Console**: If you're creating the cluster through the console, navigate to `Add-ons`, find the `CPLN Platform` add-on in the list of available add-ons, and toggle it on.

### After Cluster Creation

If the CPLN Platform add-on was not enabled during the cluster creation, you can still enable it using either method.

## Uninstall Procedure
To uninstall BYOK from a cluster, follow this guide: [Uninstall Procedure](/byok/overview#uninstall-procedure)

### Notes

- The `location` field is required and must be set to a valid CPLN BYOK location.
- You CANNOT change the `location` field after it has been set
