title:  Local Path Storage
---

## [Overview](#overview)

The Local Path Storage add-on enables the [Rancher Local Path Provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner).
This feature allows users to automatically create persistent volumes based on either `hostPath` or `local` storage on the node.

Before using this feature, be aware that Local Volumes have their own limitations. It's important to familiarize yourself with
`hostPath` and `local` volumes, including their purposes and limitations. For more information, refer to the
[Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/).

## [How to Enable](#how-to-enable)

The Local Path Storage add-on can be enabled for your Kubernetes cluster either during the cluster creation process or at any time thereafter.
The following sections outline the methods for enabling the add-on:

### [At Cluster Creation](#at-cluster-creation)

- **Through Cluster Manifest**: Add the following snippet to your cluster manifest when creating the cluster:

  ```YAML
  spec:
    ...
    addOns:
      localPathStorage: {}
    ...
  ```

- **Using the Console**: If you're creating the cluster through the console, navigate to `Add-ons`, find the `Local Path Storage` add-on in the list of available add-ons, and toggle it on.

### [After Cluster Creation](#after-cluster-creation)

If the Local Path Storage add-on was not enabled during the cluster creation, you can still enable it using either of the following methods:

#### [Using Manifest](#how-to-enable-manifest)

To enable the Local Path Storage add-on after cluster creation, add the following to your cluster's YAML manifest:

- **Direct Edit & Apply**: Navigate to your cluster in the Console, and use the `Edit & Apply` option.
- **CLI Application**: Apply the entire manifest using the `cpln apply >_` command or through the `cpln` [CLI](/(/api-reference/cli).

  ```YAML
  spec:
    ...
    addOns:
      localPathStorage: {}
    ...
  ```

#### [Using the UI](#how-to-enable-ui)

1. **Navigate to the Control Plane Console**: Open [Control Plane Console](https://console.cpln.io/console/).
2. **Select Your Kubernetes Cluster**: In the Control Plane Console, go to `Kubernetes` in the left sidebar, and click on the cluster you wish to configure.
3. **Activate the Dashboard**: Choose `Add-ons`, find the `Local Path Storage` add-on in the list, and toggle it on.

## [Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions)

It is now possible to create Pods backed by `hostPath` and `local` volumes.

### [Create a StatefulSet that uses a local volume for the storage of its pods](#create-statefulset)

Create the following StatefulSet in your Managed Kubernetes cluster. For guidance on accessing your cluster,
refer to the documentation page of your provider.

```YAML

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-localpath
  labels:
    app: nginx-localpath

    - port: 80

  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: nginx-localpath
