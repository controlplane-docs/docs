## Overview
Sysbox is an open-source and free container runtime (a specialized "runc"), originally developed by Nestybox (acquired by Docker on 05/2022), that enhances containers in two key ways:

* Improves container isolation
* Enables containers to run same workloads as VMs:

    With Sysbox, containers can run system-level software such as systemd, Docker, Kubernetes, K3s, buildx (including multi-arch builds), legacy apps, multi-arch apps, and more seamlessly & securely.

    This software can run inside Sysbox containers without modification and without using special versions of the software (e.g., rootless variants).

    No privileged containers, no complex images, no tricky entrypoints, no special volume mounts, etc.
