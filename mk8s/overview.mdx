title: Managed Kubernetes
---

The Managed Kubernetes service developed by Control Plane is designed to facilitate the creation and management (i.e., upgrades and scaling) of Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud platforms and private cloud environments. By offering a unified view for Kubernetes cluster management, this service enables the centralized management of numerous clusters on various cloud platforms, private clouds, and across accounts.

Managed Kubernetes handles the tasks required to maintain a healthy Kubernetes cluster. In addition, it manages autoscaling according to user preferences, optimizes costs by using spot instances when provided, and allows seamless upgrades based on the user's selected version.

## CNCF Certified

## Requirements
In order to use Managed Kubernetes make sure these requirements are met:
* Linux OS
* recent kernel (> 5.4)
* Internet access (for mk8s to download components)
* member nodes of the cluster must be able to see/talk to each other (same VPC, same L2 network etc).

Contact support if you want to run mk8s in an airgapped environment or have a hard dependency on a particular Linux flavor or kernel.
