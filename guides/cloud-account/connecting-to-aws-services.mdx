- Cloud Account Creation

  - When registering a cloud account targeting AWS, your AWS administrator will manually create a new AWS role (named `cpln-ORG_NAME`) with the following policies:
    - Create a new policy named `cpln-connector` which has the necessary access to create and manage roles.
    - `ReadOnlyAccess` which "provides read-only access to AWS services and resources".
  - A "trust relationship" is associated with this role that allows the Control Plane AWS account to assume this role.

- Identity Creation

  - When an [identity](/reference/identity) is created targeting AWS, Control Plane will create a new role in AWS that will have the minimum permissions that are required to access the targeted services. When a [workload](/concepts/workload) that is assigned with an [identity](/reference/identity) requests credentials to access AWS services, Control Plane will obtain a temporary access token that impersonates the role and inject it into the [workload](/concepts/workload) granting it access.
