- Removing an Azure Cloud Account for Azure SDK

  - If you no longer require Control Plane to create identities targeting Azure:

    - Delete all cloud access rules targeting Azure from existing workload [identities](/reference/identity). This will delete any associated app registrations.
    - Delete the cloud account.
    - Delete the [azure secret](/reference/secret#azure-sdk) that was mapped to the cloud account (named: CLOUD_ACCOUNT-access).
    - Your Azure administrator will need to delete the Service Principal from Azure by running the following Azure CLI command:

    ```bash
    az ad sp delete --id http://cpln-ORG_NAME
    ```
