- Removing an AWS Cloud Account
  - If you no longer require Control Plane to create identities targeting AWS:
    - Delete all cloud access rules targeting AWS from existing workload [identities](/reference/identity). This will delete any associated roles.
    - Delete the cloud account.
    - Your AWS administrator will need to remove the `cpln-connector` policy and the `cpln-ORG_NAME` role.
