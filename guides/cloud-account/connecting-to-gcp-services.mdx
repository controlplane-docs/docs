- Cloud Account Creation

  - When registering a cloud account targeting GCP, your GCP administrator will add the Control Plane GCP service account as a member of your GCP account with the following roles:
    - `Viewer`
    - `Service Account Admin`
    - `Service Account Token Creator`
  - The Control Plane GCP service account is in the format: `cpln-ORG_NAME@ENV.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

- Identity Creation

  - When an [identity](/reference/identity) is created targeting GCP, Control Plane will create a new `Service Account` in your GCP account that will have the minimum permissions that are required to access the targeted services.
  - When a [workload](/concepts/workload) that is assigned with an [identity](/reference/identity) requests credentials to access GCP services, Control Plane will obtain a temporary access token that impersonates the service account and inject it into the [workload](/concepts/workload) granting it access.
  - If the [identity](/reference/identity) created connects with a particular GCP service, the Control Plane GCP service account will need to be granted the `Admin` role for that service.
    - For example, if the [identity](/reference/identity) will be using Cloud Store, the `cpln-ORG_NAME@ENV.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service account needs to have the `Storage Admin` role granted to it. By adding this role, Control Plane will be able to grant temporary access token to the workload when reading/writing to a storage bucket.
    - Control Plane will not be able to assign roles similar to `Compute Network User` because the `Compute Admin` was not assigned to the `cpln-ORG_NAME@ENV.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service account.

<Tip>

If your workload [identities](/reference/identity) will be using a lot of GCP services, instead of granting the `Admin` role for each service, it will be easier to grant the `cpln-ORG_NAME@ENV.iam.gserviceaccount.com` service account the `Owner` role.
