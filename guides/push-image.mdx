title: Push an Image
---

## Overview

Follow the steps below to push an [image](/reference/image) to your [org's](/reference/org) private [image registry](/reference/image).

When configuring a [workload](/reference/workload) using the UI, the list of available [images](/reference/image) stored in your private [image registry](/reference/image) can be viewed by pressing `CTRL+I` on your keyboard.

An [image](/reference/image) can be pushed by using either [Docker](#push-docker), the [CLI](#push-cpln), or any Docker compatible client.

## Prerequisites

- Review the [image](/reference/image) reference page.
- [Minimum Policy](/reference/image#minimum-policy) to push an [image](/reference/image).
- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and the [CLI](/reference/cli).

## Push using Docker

### Step 1 - Set up Docker authentication (Required)

Executing the command below will update the local Docker profile to use the CLI to authentication to your private registry when performing the push.

```bash
cpln image docker-login --org ORG_NAME
```

<Tip>

The cpln [profile](/guides/manage-profile) named `default` will be used by Docker when authenticating to the private registry before the pushing
the image. If a different profile is required for authentication, set the `CPLN_PROFILE` environment variable to the desired profile name.

</Tip>

### Step 2 - Build a new image using Docker and a Dockerfile (Optional)

If you have an existing [image](/reference/image), skip to [step 3](#step-3-tag-an-existing-image-optional).

Executing the command below will [containerize](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) your application using the defined [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). The [image](/reference/image) generated will be tagged in the format required to push it to your private registry.

```bash
docker build -t ORG_NAME.registry.cpln.io/IMAGE[:TAG] .
```

<Tip>

When building on a system architecture which is not amd64 (such as an M1/M2 Mac), use the following docker command:

`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t ORG_NAME.registry.cpln.io/IMAGE[:TAG] .`

</Tip>

### Step 3 - Tag an existing image (Optional)

Executing the command below will [tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/) an existing local [image](/reference/image) in the format required to push it to your private registry.

**Required Image Name Format:** `ORG_NAME.registry.cpln.io/IMAGE[:TAG]`

If your [image](/reference/image) is already tagged in this format, skip to [step 4](#step-4-push-image-to-your-private-registry).

```bash
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] ORG_NAME.registry.cpln.io/IMAGE[:TAG]
```

### Step 4 - Push image to your private registry

Executing the command below will authenticate and push the [image](/reference/image) to your private [image registry](/reference/image).

```bash
docker push ORG_NAME.registry.cpln.io/IMAGE[:TAG]
```

Depending on the size of the [image](/reference/image) and its dependencies, it might take a few minutes for the push to complete.

### Step 5 - Use image in a workload

Once an [image](/reference/image) has been successfully pushed to your [org's](/reference/org) private [image registry](/reference/image), it can be referred to by a [workload's container](/reference/workload#containers).

When setting up a [workload](/reference/workload), the list of available [images](/reference/image) stored in your private [image registry](/reference/image) can be viewed and selected by pressing `CTRL+I` on your keyboard.

## Push using cpln

Another method to push an [image](/reference/image) to your private registry is by using the CLI's [image build](/reference/cli#image-build) command.

### Option 1: Using buildpacks

Executing the command below will:

- Automatically build the [image](/reference/image) using [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/). No [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) is required.
- Tag it with the required format.
- and push it to your private [image registry](/reference/image).

Buildpacks will crawl the application code and try to generate the [image](/reference/image). If it is unable to automatically generate the [image](/reference/image), you will need to use [option 2](#option-2-using-a-dockerfile).

```bash
cpln image build --name IMAGE:TAG --push --org ORG_NAME
```

### Option 2: Using a Dockerfile

Executing the command below is similar to [option 1](#option-1-using-buildpacks), but will build the [image](/reference/image) using Docker and will follow the instructions in the [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

```bash
cpln image build --dockerfile PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE/Dockerfile --name IMAGE:TAG --push --org ORG_NAME
```

## Authentication using a Service Account

In situations where the [CLI](/reference/cli) cannot be used, authentication to your private [image registry](/reference/image) is achieved by using a [Service Account](/guides/create-service-account).

Use the following parameters to authenticate using Docker or any Docker compatible client:

- Registry Server Hostname: `ORG_NAME.registry.cpln.io`
- Username: `'<token>'`
   <Note>The username is the literal string `'<token>'` (See example below).</Note>
- Password: `Service Account Key`
  <Note>Refer to the [Create a Service Account](/guides/create-service-account) guide for instructions on how to generate a new key.</Note>

<Tip>

The Service Account Key is a sensitive value and should be stored securely/encrypted.

If the key is compromised, it can be deleted and a new one generated.

</Tip>

### Example using Docker

```bash
echo $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY | docker login ORG_NAME.registry.cpln.io -u '<token>' --password-stdin
```

After successfully authenticating to your private [image registry](/reference/image), the [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) will be able push images based on a defined [Policy](/reference/policy). Refer to the [Image Policy](/reference/image#minimum-policy) reference page for instructions on how to configure the minimum policy necessary to push images.

## Next Steps

Once an [image](/reference/image) has been successfully pushed to your [org's](/reference/org) private [image registry](/reference/image), it can be referred to by a [workload's container](/reference/workload#containers).

When setting up a [workload](/reference/workload), the list of available [images](/reference/image) stored in your private [image registry](/reference/image) can be viewed and selected by pressing `CTRL+I` on your keyboard.

Refer to the [image build](/reference/cli#image-build) command for additional details.
