1. Make sure the workload is assigned an identity that is granted writeAudit permissions to your custom audit context.
2. Write events using the internal audit endpoint

   ```bash
   #minimal example
   curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:43000/audit/org/${CPLN_ORG}/auditctx/custom-audit-context?async=true -d '{"resource": {"id": "anyid123", "type": "anytype"}}'
   ```
