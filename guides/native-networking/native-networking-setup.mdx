title: Native Networking Setup
---

## Overview

Follow the steps to configure Native Networking within an [identity](/refrence/identity) with [AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/what-is-privatelink.html) or [GCP Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect).

### Prerequisites

- Review the [identity](/reference/identity) reference page.
- Create a resource with one of the following:
    - For AWS, a resource is created with PrivateLink configured.
    - For GCP, a resource is created with Private Service Connect configured [(see example)](/guides/native-networking/private-service-connect/cloud-sql).
- Control Plane support has created an endpoint using your resource's service name (AWS) or service attachment (GCP).

## Create using the UI Console

1. Create or edit an [identity](/guides/create-identity).
2. Navigate to the ```Native Networking``` tab on the left hand side.
3. Select ```Add Native Networking```
4. In the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) field, enter a unique name.
5. In the Name field, enter another unique name that does not match the FQDN.
<Tip>
Your workload can reference either the FQDN or the Name as an environment variable to connect using the [identity](/reference/identity). If the internal resource is configured with TLS, the FQDN must be used.
</Tip>
6. Add a port number.
<Note>
You can configure multiple Native Networking connections to different resources by specifying different port numbers for each resource. Each new database that is created in the cloud will require a new PrivateLink/Private Service Connect endpoint.
</Note>
7. Select your ```Cloud Provider```.
    - If using AWS choose ```AWS PrivateLink``` and paste your service name.
    - If using GCP choose ```GCP Service Connect``` and paste your service attachment.
8. Select ```Add``` to finish configuring Native Networking.

## Next Steps

- Finish creating/updating your [identity](/guides/create-identity).
- The identity can be associated with one or more of your [workload's identity](/reference/workload#identity) setting.
