title: Export Metrics to Prometheus
---

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to export metrics from multiple organizations using the Prometheus `/federate` endpoint.
This setup allows you to centralize metrics collection by federating Control Plane metrics into a single external Prometheus instance or service that can collect data using a Prometheus scrape job.

### Prerequisites

- Superuser access to the Control Plane Console for each organization.
- A Prometheus instance configured to scrape metrics or a third party service that can collect metrics using a Prometheus scrape job.

### Steps

#### In the Source Organization

1. **Create a Service Account:**
   - Log in to the [Console](https://console.cpln.io).
   - Create a new Service Account named `prometheus-federate`.

2. **Generate a Key:**
   - Create a new key for the `prometheus-federate` Service Account and save it securely.

3. **Create a Policy:**

You can create the policy using either the Control Plane Console UI or by using YAML configuration.

**Using the Control Plane Console UI:**

- Create a policy named `prometheus-federate` that grants `readMetrics` permission to the Service Account.
- Navigate to the Policies section in the Control Plane Console.
- Click on `New +` and fill in the details:
  - **Name**: `prometheus-federate`
  - **Description**: `prometheus-federate`
  - **Target Kind**: `org`
- Click `Next (Bindings)`:
- Click `Add Binding`:
  - On the `Permissions` tab, check `readMetrics`
  - On the `Service Accounts` tab, check `prometheus-federate`
- Click `Add`
- Click `Create`

**Using YAML Configuration:**

   ```yaml
   kind: policy
   name: prometheus-federate
   description: prometheus-federate
   tags: {}
   bindings:
     - permissions:
         - readMetrics
       principalLinks:
         - /org/org-2/serviceaccount/prometheus-federate
   target: all
   targetKind: org
   ```

#### In the Prometheus Configuration

1. **Configure Scrape Job:**
   - Add the following scrape configuration to your Prometheus instance:

   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'federate'
       scrape_interval: 15s
       honor_labels: true
       scheme: https
       metrics_path: '/metrics/org/${org}/api/v1/federate'
       params:
         'match[]':
           - '{__name__=~".+"}'  # Adjust this matcher as needed
       authorization:
         type: Bearer
         credentials: "${CPLN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN}"  # Token value from env variable
       static_configs:
         - targets:
             - 'metrics.cpln.io'
   ```

   - Replace `${org}` with the actual organization name.
   - Ensure `${CPLN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN}` is set as an environment variable containing the token from the `prometheus-federate` Service Account.

### Verification

- After configuring the scrape job, verify that Prometheus is successfully collecting metrics from the source organization by checking the Prometheus UI.
- You should be able to see the same metrics in the Prometheus UI as you would in the Control Plane managed Grafana instance.

### Additional Notes

- Adjust the `match[]` parameter in the scrape configuration to filter the metrics as needed.
- Repeat the steps for additional organizations by creating separate Service Accounts and policies. 
- Egress charges apply to metrics being scraped from the Control Plane.

### Cleanup

- Delete the scrape job in the Prometheus instance.
- Delete the Policy and Service Account in the source organization.
