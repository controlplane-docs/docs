title: cpln workload connect
---

## Overview

The [cpln workload connect](/reference/cli#workload-connect) command is designed to establish a direct remote terminal connection to your workload replica at a specific location, allowing you to interact with the terminal session of the workload replica. This guide outlines how to effectively use the [workload connect](/reference/cli#workload-connect) command, enabling you to perform tasks such as troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- [CLI](/reference/cli) installed and [authenticated](/guides/manage-profile) with a default profile, [org](/reference/org) and [gvc](/reference/gvc).
- A running [workload](/reference/workload) in at least one location. Refer to our [create a workload](/guides/create-workload) guide.
- Permissions to interact with the [workload](/reference/workload#permissions).

## Options

### Optional

- `--location`
  - The location associated with the workload deployment (e.g., `aws-us-west-1`). Defaults to the first location fetched from the specified GVC. When specifying, make sure that the specified location is part of the specified GVC.
- `--replica`
  - The replica name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first replica.
- `--container`
  - The container name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first container.
- `shell`, `-s`
  - The shell to use upon connecting to the workload replica. Defaults to `bash`.

## Basic Connect

To initiate a basic connection, you need the workload's name and its deployment location.

#### Retrieve Workload Deployments

```
cpln workload get-deployments WORKLOAD_NAME
```

This command lists the available locations. Identify the location name from the output.

#### Connect to Workload

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION
```

This command connects to the first replica and container in the specified location.

## Advanced Connect

### Specific Replica

In cases where there are more than one replica in a workload deployment and you would like to connect to a specific one, you can provide the `--replica` option followed by the replicas name.

#### List Replicas

```
cpln workload replica get WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION
```

To override the output format, use the `--output` option followed by the desired format (YAML, JSON, etc.).

#### Connect to a Replica

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --replica REPLICA_NAME
```

### Specific Container

Within a workload where numerous containers are configured, regardless if a container is handling traffic or functioning as a sidecar, it is feasible to establish a connection to it by using the `--container` option.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --container CONTAINER_NAME
```

### Specific Shell

Different container environments may require or support different shells environments in order to connect, such as `bash` or `sh`.

To specify the shell, use the `--shell` option.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --shell SHELL_NAME
```
