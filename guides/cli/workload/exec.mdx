title: cpln workload exec
---

## Overview

The [cpln workload exec](/reference/cli#workload-exec) command lets you execute a specific command followed by custom arguments in a workload replica at a specific location.

## Prerequisites

- [CLI](/reference/cli) installed and [authenticated](/guides/manage-profile) with a default profile, [org](/reference/org) and [gvc](/reference/gvc).
- A running [workload](/reference/workload) in at least one location. Refer to our [create a workload](/guides/create-workload) guide.
- Permissions to interact with the [workload](/reference/workload#permissions).

## Options

### Required

- `--`
  - Command to execute on replica (e.g., `echo hello world`).

### Optional

- `--stdin`, `-i`
  - Pass stdin to the container. Default: `false`.
- `--tty`, `-t`
  - Stdin is a TTY. Default: `false`.
- `--quiet`, `-q`
  - Only print output from the remote session. Default: `false`.
- `--location`
  - The location associated with the workload deployment (e.g., `aws-us-west-1`). Defaults to the first location fetched from the specified GVC. When specifying, make sure that the specified location is part of the specified GVC.
- `--replica`
  - The replica name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first replica.
- `--container`
  - The container name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first container.

## Basic Usage

#### Retrieve Workload Deployments

```
cpln workload get-deployments WORKLOAD_NAME
```

This command lists available locations. Identify the location name from the output.

#### Usage

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION -- COMMAND ARG1 ARG2
```

## Advanced Usage

### Specific Replica

In cases where you have more than one replica in a workload deployment and you would like to execute a command in one of them, you can provide the `--replica` option followed by the replicas name.

#### List Replicas

```
cpln workload replica get WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION
```

To override the output format, use the `--output` option followed by the desired format (YAML, JSON, etc.).

#### Execute Within a Specific Replica

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --replica REPLICA_NAME -- COMMAND ARG1 ARG2
```

### Specific Container

Within a workload where numerous containers are configured, regardless if a container is handling traffic or functioning as a sidecar, it is feasible to execute a command to it by using the `--container` option.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --container CONTAINER_NAME -- COMMAND ARG1 ARG2
```

### Sending Stdin

To send stdin to a command executed within a workload, use the `-i` or `--stdin` option.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME -i --location LOCATION --container CONTAINER_NAME -- COMMAND ARG1 ARG2
```

### Starting an Interactive Session

To start an interactive session using the exec command, combine the `-i` and `-t` options (or use `-it`). This allows you to run a shell command within a container interactively.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME -it -- /bin/bash
```
