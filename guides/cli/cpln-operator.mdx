## Overview

The [cpln operator](/reference/cli#operator) command manages the Kubernetes secret required for Control Plane integration. This command provides two subcommands:

- [install](#install-command): Creates a Kubernetes secret which grants the Control Plane operator access to one of your orgs.
- [uninstall](#uninstall-command): Removes the operator-installed secret from your cluster.

<Info>
  If a secret with the organization name already exists and was not installed by the operator, the installation will fail to prevent
  conflicts.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- [CLI](/reference/cli) installed.
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster with permissions to create namespaces and secrets.

## operator install

Creates a Kubernetes secret which grants the Control Plane operator access to one of your orgs.

### Options

#### Required

- `--serviceaccount, -s`
  - The Control Plane service account name for the operator. If it does not exist, a new one will be created.

#### Optional

- `--serviceaccount-group, -g`
  - The group to assign to the specified service account. Defaults to `"superusers"`.
- `--export`
  - Export the Kubernetes resources to a stdout instead of applying them directly to the cluster.

### Usage Example

To install the Kubernetes operator and create the necessary service account and secret, run:

```bash
cpln operator install --serviceaccount my-operator-sa --serviceaccount-group superusers --org demo-org --profile default
```

This command will:

- Check if `my-operator-sa` exists; If not, create it.
- Assign the service account to the `superusers` group.
- Generate a key for the service account and create a Kubernetes secret named `demo-org` in the `controlplane` namespace.
- Abort if a conflicting secret (not installed by the operator) already exists.

### Exporting Kubernetes Resources

If you prefer to export the operator's Kubernetes resource definitions without applying them immediately, use:

```bash
cpln operator install --serviceaccount my-operator-sa --export --org demo-org --profile default
```

This outputs the resource definitions so you can inspect or apply them manually.

## operator uninstall

Removes the operator-installed secret from your cluster.

### Usage Example

To uninstall the operator and remove its secret from your cluster, run:

```bash
cpln operator uninstall --org demo-org --profile default
```

The command searches for the secret (identified by a special annotation) in the `controlplane` namespace and deletes it. If the secret is not found, the command exits with code 0.
