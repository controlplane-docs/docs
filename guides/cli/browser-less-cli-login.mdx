title: Browserless CLI Login
---

## Overview

You can use the CLI without an interactive login by using a [service account](/reference/serviceaccount).

## Prerequisites

- The user executing the steps below must be a member of the [superusers group](/reference/group#built-in-groups) or have a [policy](/reference/policy), targeting [service accounts](/reference/serviceaccount), with the following [permissions](/reference/policy#permissions):
  - create
  - edit
  - addKey
- [CLI](/reference/cli) installed

## Required Steps

To set up a [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) used by the CLI to perform a browserless login:

1. Using the console:

   - [Create a Service Account](/guides/create-service-account) whose key will be used in step #2.

   - Create one or more [policies](/guides/policy) granting the [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) permissions to resources (GVCs, workloads, etc.) as required.

<Tip>
If you wish, the CLI can be used instead of using the console.

See [service account create](/reference/cli#serviceaccount-create), [service account add-key](/reference/cli#serviceaccount-add-key), [policy create](/reference/cli#policy-create), [policy add-binding](/reference/cli#policy-add-binding)

</Tip>

2. To configure the CLI to use the [service account](/reference/serviceaccount), run the following command (choose your own PROFILE_NAME):

```
cpln profile create PROFILE_NAME --token SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FROM_STEP_1
```

3. To set the profile as the default, run the following command:

```
cpln profile set-default PROFILE_NAME
```

Once the profile is set as the default, subsequent CLI commands will run as the [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) with its permissions.

## Troubleshooting

If logging in with a [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) using the steps above is not executing the CLI commands as expected, add the service account to the `superusers` [group](/reference/group#built-in-groups).

This [group](/reference/group) will give full access to the [service account](/reference/serviceaccount). If the CLI commands are now returning as expected, additional permissions will need to be added to the [service account](/reference/serviceaccount) using [policies](/guides/policy).

If it is still not working, ensure that the default profile is set to PROFILE_NAME.
