## Overview

The [cpln helm](/reference/cli#helm) command streamlines the process of managing Control Plane resources
by leveraging the output generated by the [helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template) command. This functionality proves invaluable for those preferring to define their Control Plane
resources within a [helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/), facilitating regular
updates to these resources with ease.

To ensure a seamless transition for users familiar with the original [helm](https://helm.sh) commands, we
have intentionally designed our CLI helm subcommands to closely resemble their helm counterparts. This approach aims to minimize confusion and provide a familiar environment, as our CLI helm command adheres to the same foundational principles and workflows
as the traditional helm commands.

## Prerequisites

- [CLI](/reference/cli) installed.
- [helm](https://helm.sh) installed.
- Defined [policies](/concepts/policy) to create applicable Control Plane resources.
- [Policy](/concepts/policy) to reveal applicable [secrets](/reference/secret).

## Definitions

### cpln release

The definition of a `cpln release` mirrors that of a [helm release](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#three-big-concepts), essentially representing a deployed instance
of a [helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts) within Control Plane. Executing a `cpln release` involves the use of the [cpln helm install](/reference/cli#helm-install) command. Each [upgrade](#upgrade-a-release) ensures that the resources defined in the [helm chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts) are appropriately applied. The [upgrade](#upgrade-a-release) also takes care of removing any resources that are no longer part of the chart and updates the [cpln release state](#cpln-release-state) to reflect these changes.

When you run the [cpln helm install](/reference/cli#helm-install) command, it results in the creation of a secret of type [opaque](/reference/secret#opaque) within your org. This secret is integral to the process, as it contains the payload corresponding to the [cpln release state](#cpln-release-state).

### cpln release state

The `cpln release state` serves as the definitive source for managing releases through the CLI. This functionality is crucial for understanding the dynamics of your deployments, such as identifying when a new resource is introduced or an existing one is removed. The CLI achieves this by comparing the current `cpln release state` with the output from the [helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template) command.

The `cpln release state` is structured as a JSON object, which includes:

- `schemaVersion`
  - Represents the version of the generator used to create the `cpln release state`. This is particularly important for version control, especially when updates are made to the state's structure or functionalities by the CLI.
- `release`
  - This key stores the name of the release, allowing for easy identification and reference.
- `deployments`
  - A list of deployments. Each [install](#install-a-release)/[upgrade](#upgrade-a-release) adds a new deployment in which it can be [rolled back](#rollback-a-release) to. Each deployment consists of the following properties:
    - `gvc`: The value of the `--gvc` option that was specified on install/upgrade.
    - `revision`: The revision number of the deployment. Each time you update or roll back a release, the revision number increases. It helps you keep track of changes made to your deployment over time.
    - `updated`: The last modified date and time in UTC format.
    - `status`: The status of the deployment is equivalent to the helm deployment status. The value could be one of the following:
      - superseded
      - deployed
      - failed
      - pending-install
      - pending-upgrade
      - pending-rollback
      - uninstalling
      - uninstalled
    - `chart`: The name of the helm chart.
    - `appVersion`: The `appVersion` that is defined within the **Chart.yml** file.
    - `description`: The string passed to the `--description` flag in the [cpln helm install](/reference/cli#helm-install) and [cpln helm upgrade](/reference/cli#helm-upgrade) commands, providing contextual information about the release.
    - `values`: A string that contains the contents of the `values.yaml` file along with any additional values provided through the `-f` or `--values` options.
    - `resources`
      - A list of the active resources that were defined in the last [cpln release](#cpln-release) install. Each item is an object that has the following properties that are relative to the resource:
        - `id`: A unique identifier for the resource.
        - `kind`: Specifies the type of the resource.
        - `version`: The version of the resource.
        - `link`: The self-link of the resource.
        - `template`: The resource definition extracted from the output generated by the [helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template) command.

## Create a Helm Chart

To create a helm chart, follow these steps:

1. In an empty directory, execute the command (substitute CHART_NAME with your desired name):
   - `helm create CHART_NAME`
2. A directory named `CHART_NAME` will be created which will contain the following resources:
   - Directories: `charts` and `templates`
   - Files: `.helmignore`, `Chart.yaml`, and `values.yaml`
3. Delete the contents of the `templates` directory.
4. Using your favorite text editor, open the `values.yaml` file and replace the contents with the following:

```yaml YAML
exampleGvc:
  name: example-gvc
  description: This is a description
  locationLinks:
    - //location/aws-eu-central-1

exampleHttpbinWorkload:
  name: httpbin-example

exampleIdentity:
  name: example-identity
```

5. Create a file called `resources.yaml` within the `templates` directory and paste the following:

```yaml YAML
kind: gvc
name: {{ .Values.exampleGvc.name }}
description: {{ .Values.exampleGvc.description }}
spec:
  staticPlacement:
    locationLinks:
    {{- range .Values.exampleGvc.locationLinks }}
      - {{ . }}
    {{- end }}
---
kind: identity
name: {{ .Values.exampleIdentity.name }}
description: {{ .Values.exampleIdentity.name }}
gvc: {{ .Values.exampleGvc.name }}
---
kind: workload
name: {{ .Values.exampleHttpbinWorkload.name }}
description: {{ .Values.exampleHttpbinWorkload.name }}
gvc: {{ .Values.exampleGvc.name }}
spec:
  identityLink: //gvc/{{ .Values.exampleGvc.name }}/identity/{{ .Values.exampleIdentity.name }}
  type: serverless
  containers:
    - name: httpbin

      metric: concurrency
      minScale: 1
      scaleToZeroDelay: 300
      target: 100
    capacityAI: true
    debug: false
    suspend: true
    timeoutSeconds: 5
  firewallConfig:
    external:
      inboundAllowCIDR:
        - 0.0.0.0/0
      outboundAllowCIDR:
        - 0.0.0.0/0
      outboundAllowHostname: []
      outboundAllowPort: []
    internal:
      inboundAllowType: none
      inboundAllowWorkload: []
  localOptions: []
  supportDynamicTags: false
```

## Generate a Helm Template

The [cpln helm template](/reference/cli#helm-template) command will
execute the [helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template) command in the background and will output to stdout.

Example:

```
cpln helm template NAME PATH_TO_HELM_CHART
```

<Accordion title="Output from executing the chart created in the above example">

### Helm Template Options

For the list of options, browse to the [cpln helm template](/reference/cli#helm-template) command and expand the `References` panel.

<Tip>If the release name is not specified, the flag `--generate-name` must be added and will auto generate a release name.</Tip>

### Injected Values

The following values get injected into the [cpln helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template) command which can be accessed from within your chart.

- Key: `cpln.org`, Value: `Name of your organization`.
- Key: `cpln.gvc`, Value: `Name of your GVC`.

Example Usage:

```
{{ .Values.cpln.org }}
```

<Warning>
  It is recommended that you avoid defining a top-level `cpln` property within your `values.yaml` file, as the injected values above will
  override them.
</Warning>

## Chart Notes

After executing [cpln helm install](/reference/cli#helm-install) or [cpln helm upgrade](/reference/cli#helm-upgrade), the content of the NOTES.txt file that is defined within the chart directory will be output to stdout.

## Injected Tags

When you [install](#install-a-release) or [upgrade](#upgrade-a-release), the specified tags are added to each resource that is being installed or upgraded.

- Key: `cpln/release`, Value: The name of the release.

## Tell Helm Not To Uninstall a Resource

Sometimes there are resources that should not be uninstalled. Chart developers can add the `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` tag to a resource to prevent it from being uninstalled.

```yaml YAML
kind: location
tags:
  helm.sh/resource-policy: keep
[...]
```

The tag `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` instructs the [CLI](/reference/cli) to skip deleting this resource when a `cpln helm` operation (such as `cpln helm uninstall`, `cpln helm upgrade` or `cpln helm rollback`) would result in its deletion.

## Install a Release

The [cpln helm install](/reference/cli#helm-install) command accepts the same options
as the [cpln helm template](/reference/cli#helm-template) command. It injects the same values
and executes the [helm template](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template) command in the background. It will
use the output to create, update, and remove resources based on content that is added/modified within the chart.

<Note>
  The release name should follow the same naming convention that is used to name resources in Control Plane since the name of the release
  will be part of the [secret](/reference/secret) name that will be created.
</Note>

Example usage:

```
cpln helm install NAME PATH_TO_HELM_CHART
```

<Accordion title="Output from executing the chart created in the above example">

```
Created /org/cpln-test-org/gvc/example-gvc
Created /org/cpln-test-org/gvc/example-gvc/identity/example-identity
Created /org/cpln-test-org/gvc/example-gvc/workload/httpbin-example

Release 'example' has been installed successfully!
```

</Accordion>

### Wait for Workload Readiness

To guarantee the readiness of one or more workloads during the [cpln helm install](/reference/cli#helm-install), include the `--wait` option in your command. This will enforce a default waiting period of 300 seconds (5 minutes). If you need to adjust this duration, use the `--timeout` option with your preferred number of seconds.

Example usage:

```
cpln helm install NAME PATH_TO_HELM_CHART --wait --timeout 600
```

## Upgrade a Release

If you need to modify your release following alterations to your chart — be it adding a new resource, updating an existing one, or removing
a resource — execute the [cpln helm upgrade](/reference/cli#helm-upgrade) command. It's crucial to use the same release name when running this command. This
consistency enables the CLI to accurately determine which resources should be deleted and to appropriately update the [cpln release state](#cpln-release-state) with these changes and a new deployment.

<Warning>
  A release can only have up to 10 deployments. Every additional upgrade will omit the oldest one (i.e. the deployment with the lowest
  revision number).
</Warning>

Using the above example, the updated template (resources.yaml) below has the identity and the identityLink (from the workload) removed.
