## Overview

The [cpln convert](/reference/cli#convert) command is designed to facilitate the migration from Kubernetes environments to Control Plane by converting Kubernetes objects into Control Plane objects.

Typically, this command is utilized alongside the [cpln apply](/reference/cli#apply) command to seamlessly convert and then directly apply the configurations.

## Prerequisites

- [CLI](/reference/cli) installed.

## Options

### Required

- `--file`
  - A `JSON`/`YAML` file containing Kubernetes objects. Use `--file -` to enable input from stdin.

### Optional

- `--protocol`
  - The port protocol to be assigned to each container within a workload converted from a deployment. Default: `http`. [choices: `http`, `http2`, `grpc`, `tcp`].
- `--verbose`
  - Prints each Kubernetes resource as YAML to `stderr`, mirroring the original input so you can review the conversion. Any properties or specs that were not converted remain in the output, are highlighted in yellow, and end with `(ignored)` to make it clear they were skipped.

## Limitations

The [cpln convert](/reference/cli#convert) command has specific conversion capabilities, detailed as follows:

- **Workloads Conversion**
  - Can convert objects of kind Deployment and CronJob into [workloads](/reference/workload).
- **Secrets Conversion**
  - Capable of converting objects of kind Secret into Control Plane [secrets](/reference/secret).

## Create a K8s file

To demonstrate the `convert` command, create a `k8s.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

## Convert a K8s file

### Basic Convert

The following command will convert the Kubernetes object defined in the above `k8s.yaml` file into a Control Plane object and output it to the terminal.

```
cpln convert --file k8s.yaml
```

```yaml YAML
kind: workload
name: example-deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: 'nginx:latest'
      env: []
      ports:
        - number: 80
          protocol: http
      args: []
  defaultOptions:
    suspend: false
    capacityAI: false
    autoscaling:
      minScale: 3
      maxScale: 3
  type: serverless
```

</Accordion>

### Convert With a Specific Protocol

Each Kubernetes object, whether of type `Deployment` or `CronJob`, will be transformed into workloads. These workloads will feature containers whose port protocols are aligned with the specification provided in the `--protocol` option.

```
cpln convert --file k8s.yaml --protocol tcp
```

<Accordion title="Output">

```yaml YAML
kind: workload
name: example-deployment
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: 'nginx:latest'
      env: []
      ports:
        - number: 80
          protocol: tcp
      args: []
  defaultOptions:
    suspend: false
    capacityAI: false
    autoscaling:
      minScale: 3
      maxScale: 3
  type: serverless
```

## Convert & Apply

Use the [cpln apply](/reference/cli#apply) command to convert and apply.

```
cpln apply --file k8s.yaml --k8s true
```

Alternatively, you can pass the conversion result as a stdin to the [cpln apply](/reference/cli#apply) command.

`cpln convert --file k8s.yaml | cpln apply --file - `

## Revert Apply

To revert the apply, use the following command.

```
cpln delete --file k8s.yaml --k8s true
```
