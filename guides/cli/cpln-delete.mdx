## Overview

The [cpln delete](/reference/cli#delete) command serves as the opposite of the CLI [apply](/reference/cli#apply) command. While the `apply` command creates and updates resources, the `delete` command deletes resources. Both the `apply` and the `delete` commands accept the same options.

## Using the CLI

```
cpln delete --file FILE_NAME [OPTIONS]
```

The `FILE_NAME` is the path for the file and it can be either a JSON or YAML file containing the resource metadata.

To delete an [Identity](/reference/identity), a [Volume Set](/reference/volumeset) or a [Workload](/reference/workload) resource you need to specify a GVC in one of the following methods.

- Specify a `gvc` within your [cpln profile](/guides/manage-profile). This will add the `gvc` to the session context of the profile and will be refered to as the default `gvc` when executing any future command including the `cpln delete` command.

  ```
  cpln profile update PROFILE_NAME --gvc GVC_NAME
  ```

- Specify a `--gvc` flag to the `delete` command. This will pass the `gvc` as an option and will override the default `gvc` that is defined in the session context of the profile.

  ```
  cpln delete --file FILE_NAME --gvc GVC_NAME
  ```

- Specify a `gvc` property in the resource definition in the file you wish to run the delete command against.

  ```yaml YAML
  kind: identity
  name: example-identity
  description: example-description
  tags: {}
  gvc: example-gvc
  ```

<Note>You can either specify a gvc property or a --gvc flag, you can't specify both.</Note>

### Delete an Applied K8s File

The CLI has the ability to convert K8s resources into Control Plane resources. By passing the `--k8s true` option to the `delete` command, the K8s resources will be converted and deleted.

```
cpln delete --file FILE_NAME --k8s true
```

The `delete` command will use the logic of the CLI [convert](/reference/cli#convert) command and then delete the resources defined in the output.

### Delete from Standard Input

In case you would like to pass Control Plane resources through `stdin` (Standard Input) and delete them, use the following command.

```
CONTROL_PLANE_RESOURCES | cpln delete --file -
```

<Tip>This is useful if you would like to pass the stdout of a command to the cpln delete command.</Tip>

## Using the Console

The console has the ability to upload a JSON or YAML file or accept a resource definition in JSON or YAML as input. The functionality is the same as using the CLI. Click the `cpln apply` button in the upper right corner of the console. A modal will be displayed containing the upload instructions. Enable the `Use as Delete` switch in order to delete a resource.

The cpln apply modal provides the ability to specify in which `org` and `gvc` a resource will be deleted. The default is your currently selected `org` and `gvc`.

A file or an input containing an [Identity](/reference/identity), a [Volume Set](/reference/volumeset) or a [Workload](/reference/workload) resource will be deleted in the scope of the specified `gvc` in the cpln apply modal. In case a `gvc` is defined within a resource, the resource will be deleted in the scope of that `gvc`.

## Multiple Resources

To delete multiple resources, specify a JSON array or YAML's separated with `---`.

```yaml YAML
kind: gvc
name: example-gvc
description: example-gvc
tags: {}
spec:
  staticPlacement:
    locationLinks:
      - /org/ORG_NAME/location/aws-eu-central-1
---
kind: identity
name: example-identity
description: example-identity
tags: {}
gvc: example-gvc
```
