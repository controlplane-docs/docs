## Overview

To authenticate requests to the Control Plane API, you need to include an authorization header with a Bearer token. This token can be either a user token or a service account key.

### Using a User Token

1. Obtain a user token by using the `cpln profile token --profile {profileName}` command.
2. Replace `{profileName}` with the name of the profile you want to use.
3. Copy the token generated by the command.

### Using a Service Account Key

1. Create a service account in the Control Plane platform.
2. Generate a key for the service account and copy the key.

### Adding the Authorization Header

Include the token or key in the authorization header of your API requests with the `Bearer` prefix. Here is an example using cURL:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {tokenOrKey}" https://api.cpln.io/org
```

Replace `{tokenOrKey}` with the token or key you obtained from the previous steps.

This method ensures that your API requests are authenticated and secure, allowing you to interact with the Control Plane API effectively.
