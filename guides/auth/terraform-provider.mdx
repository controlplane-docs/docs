title: "Terraform Provider"
---

Authenticating for a terraform project requires setting up required fields for the CPLN Terraform Provider Plugin. 

A `main.tf` file can have the below

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cpln = {
      source  = "controlplane-com/cpln"
      version = "~> 1.0" # This constraint means use any version in the 1.x range
    }
  }
}

provider "cpln" {
  org      = "myorg"
  profile  = "myprofile"
}
```

Setting the profile like the above example will use the CPLN CLI profile with that name, and will request a token through the profile for authentication. 

You can also directly set a token if you need to use a service account key.

```hcl
provider "cpln" {
  org      = "myorg"
  token  = "mytoken"
}
```
