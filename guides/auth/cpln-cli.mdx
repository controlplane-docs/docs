## Overview

To authenticate to the CPLN CLI, you have two primary options: using a profile with a login command or using a service account key. Here's how you can do both:

### Option 1: Using a Profile with Login

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Profile">
You can create a profile for your CPLN CLI access. This is useful if you want to manage multiple profiles for different environments or use cases.
</Step>

<Step title="Login with Profile">
Use the following command to log in with a specific profile:

   ```bash
   cpln profile {profileName} --login
   ```

   Replace `{profileName}` with the name of the profile you want to use. This command will prompt you to authenticate, typically through a web-based login flow.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Using a Service Account Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Profile with a Service Account Key">
If you have a service account key, you can create a profile using that key. This is useful for automated scripts or services that need to authenticate without user interaction.
</Step>

<Step title="Use the Service Account Key">
Use the following command to create a profile with a service account key:

   ```bash
   cpln profile create {name} --token {serviceAccountKey}
   ```

   Replace `{name}` with the desired name for your profile and `{serviceAccountKey}` with your actual service account key. This will set up a profile that uses the service account key for authentication.
</Step>
</Steps>
