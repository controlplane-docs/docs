---

## Prerequisites

- Review the [org](/reference/org) reference page
- [Permissions](#permissions) to create an [org](/reference/org)
- Optional:
  - Install the [CLI](/reference/cli)

## Permissions

To create an org, the `org_creator` or `billing_admin` role must be assigned to a user by a billing admin from the `Org Management & Billing` dashboard.

Follow the steps below to access the Org Management & Billing dashboard and assign the role:

1. Click the profile icon in the upper right corner and select `Org Management & Billing`.
2. Click the `Users` link in the left menu.
3. If the user is not shown in the current users list, enter their email address, select the `org_creator` or `billing_admin` role, and click `Add User`. The user will receive a verification email.
4. If the user is already on the current users list and they don't have the `org_creator` or `billing_admin` role, click the `Edit` button corresponding to the user, select the `org_creator` or `billing_admin` role and click `Confirm`.

## Create using the UI Console

Follow the steps below to create an org:

1. Click the `Create` button in the upper right corner and select `Org`.
2. Enter a unique name, optional description, and any additional org admin email addresses. Click `Next (Tags)`.
3. Enter any optional [tags](/reference/misc#tags) and click `Create`. The user creating the role, and any additional org admins, will automatically be assigned to the `superusers` group.

## Create using the CLI

Refer to the [org create](/reference/cli#org-create) command for details and examples on how to create an org using the CLI.
