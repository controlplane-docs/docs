title: Private Network

### Overview

Follow the steps below to install and configure an [agent](/reference/agent) within your private network.

### Prerequisites

- Review the [Agent](/reference/agent) reference page.
- Install the [CLI](/reference/cli).
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Step One - Create an Agent

Follow the [Create an Agent](/guides/agent) guide to define an agent and generate the bootstrap config file that will be used in
[step two](#step-two-launch-agent-locally).

### Step Two - Launch agent locally

1. Open a new shell and execute the following command. Use the bootstrap file that was created in [step one](#step-one-create-an-agent-4).

```
cpln agent up --bootstrap-file=PATH/AGENT_NAME-bootstrapConfig.json
```

<Tip>

If you are using Windows, follow these instructions:

- Configure Docker to **not** use the WSL 2 based engine.
- Run the `cpln` command above using a Windows command prompt and not using WSL.

</Tip>

2. The agent will now be running, connecting to the Control Plane servers, and ready to process requests.

### Next Steps

Now that you have an agent configured and running, it can be used within an [identity](/reference/identity) to allow your [workload](/reference/workload) to connect to your local resources.

<Tip>
  When running an agent locally, it is running within a local Docker container. When configuring an [identity network
  resource](/reference/identity#network-resources-cloud-wormhole), you must use the IP of the network adapter that Docker installed on the
  local machine.
