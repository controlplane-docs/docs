title: Create a GVC
---

## Overview

Follow the steps below to create a [GVC](/reference/gvc) within your [org](/reference/org).

## Prerequisites

- Review the [GVC](/reference/gvc) reference page
- [Permissions](/reference/policy#permissions) to create a [GVC](/reference/gvc)
- Optional:
  - Install the [CLI](/reference/cli)

## Create using the UI Console

Follow the steps below to create a GVC:

1. Create a new GVC using one of the following methods:

   - For an [org](/reference/org) without any GVCs:
     - After logging in, the `Create GVC` page will be shown, or if you browse to a different page,
     - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `GVC`
   - For an [org](/reference/org) with at least one GVC:
     - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `GVC`

2. Enter a unique name, optional description, and select a [domain](/reference/domain). If there are no domains defined, use the `Default`. Custom domains can be added later. Click `Next (Locations)`.
3. Select at least one of the listed cloud providers. Click `Next (Pull Secrets)`
4. The [Docker/ECR/GCP Pull Secrets](/reference/gvc#pull-secrets) that have been configured for your [org](/reference/org) will be listed. If any secrets are shown, select one or more secrets that would be required by your [workloads](/reference/workload) to authenticate to a private registry to pull their images. Click `Next (Tags)`.
5. Enter any optional [tags](/reference/misc#tags). Click `Create`.

Your GVC has been successfully created and is ready to be configured with a [workload](/reference/workload).

## Create using the CLI

Refer to the [GVC create](/reference/cli#gvc-create) command for details and examples on how to create a GVC using the CLI.
