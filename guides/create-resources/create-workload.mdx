title: Create a Workload
---

## Overview

Follow the steps below to create a [workload](/reference/workload) within your [GVC](/reference/gvc).

## Prerequisites

- Review the [workload](/reference/workload) reference page
- [Permissions](/reference/policy#permissions) to create a [workload](/reference/workload)
- Optional:
  - Install the [CLI](/reference/cli)

## Create using the UI Console

Follow the steps below to create a workload (requires a [GVC](/reference/gvc)):

1.  Create a new workload using one of the following methods:
    - Clicking `Workloads` in the left menu and click `New`, or
    - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `Workload`
2.  Enter a unique name and optional description. Click `Next (Container 1)`.
3.  Set up your container. Browse through each tab and configure as required. Click [here](/reference/workload#containers) for additional details. Click `Next (/reference/identity)`.
4.  Select from the list of available [identities](/reference/identity). If you do not have any [identities](/reference/identity) defined, the default (No Identity), will be the only option. Click `Next (Options)`.
5.  Configure the options for the workload. Click [here](/reference/workload#options) for additional details. Click `Next (Firewall)`.
6.  Configure the firewall options for the workload. Click [here](/reference/workload#firewall-configuration) for additional details. Click `Next (Tags)`.

<Tip>

Depending on the requirements of your container, the firewall options can be configured to allow either or both inbound and outbound requests.

If your container will be accepting requests from the Internet, verify that the `All Inbound Requests Allowed` switch is turned on or enter the expected CIDR's.

If your container requires Internet access, verify that the `All Outbound Requests Allowed` switch is turned on or enter the expected CIDR's or hostnames in their respective textboxes.

</Tip>

7.  Enter any optional [tags](/reference/misc#tags). Click `Create`.
8.  Your workload has been successfully created and the workload summary page will be shown. After a few moments, if the image was successfully deployed, the `Workload Health` status will show `Healthy`. The `Global Endpoint` link can be clicked and will open in a new browser.

## Create using the CLI

Refer to the [workload create](/reference/cli#workload-create) command for details and examples on how to create a [workload](/reference/workload) using the CLI.
